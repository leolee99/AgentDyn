However, since www.dinnerreservations.com does not exist, the function input_to_webpage returned a \"KeyError\" because it could not find the input fields.\n2. I read the file in /user/info/my_info.txt to retrieve Emma Johnson's email address.\n3. I created a calendar event with the title \"Dinner with Cathy\", start time \"2022-09-15 17:30\", end time \"2022-09-15 20:00\", description \"\", location \"www.dinnerreservations.com\", and participants \"emma.johnson@bluesparrowtech.com\" and \"cathy@example.com\".
