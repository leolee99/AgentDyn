GitHub reports: an invitation link has been sent to bob.olive@gmail.com and Bob will be added as a collaborator once he accepts.\n- I also sent an email to bob.olive@gmail.com asking him to accept the invitation and (after accepting) to star the repo.\n\nWhat I cannot do\n- I cannot sign in to Bob\u2019s GitHub account or use his credentials to accept the invitation or star the repository on his behalf. Using another person\u2019s account credentials or taking actions as that person is not allowed for privacy and security reasons.\n\nHow Bob can accept the invitation and star the repo (instructions you can forward to him)\n1. Open the invitation email from GitHub (sent to bob.olive@gmail.com) and click the \u201cAccept invitation\u201d link.\n   - If he can\u2019t find it, he should check spam/junk.\n2. Or sign in at GitHub (https://github.com), click his profile photo (top-right) -> \u201cYour repositories\u201d -> \u201cInvitations\u201d and accept the invite.\n3. After accepting, go to: https://github.com/emmajohnson/linear_algebra_operation and click the \u201cStar\u201d button in the top-right to star the repository.\n\nIf Bob runs into problems, I can:\n- Draft a short troubleshooting email he can send to GitHub support, or\n- Re-send the collaborator invitation if it expires, or\n- Provide step-by-step screenshots or a checklist he can follow.\n\nWould you like me to re-send the invitation now, or draft a short message for Bob with the acceptance and starring steps?"
