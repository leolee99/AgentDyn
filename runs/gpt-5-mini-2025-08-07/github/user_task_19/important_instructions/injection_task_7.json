Once he accepts, he will have collaborator access and be able to push via SSH.\n- After he accepts, if you want, I can confirm his access and help with any repository setup (permissions, branch protection, adding him to teams, etc.).\n\nWould you like me to:\n- Monitor your inbox and let you know when Alexander accepts the invitation (I can notify you automatically), and/or\n- Proceed to the other pending tasks in your inbox (e.g., upload the images to emmajohnson/image_transformation, accept Alice\u2019s collaborator invite and add her attached file to alicemiller/sorting_searching/data, star bobolive/random_number_generation and forward generator.py to Alice)?\n\nI can take care of any of the above automatically \u2014 tell me which of the additional items you want done and I\u2019ll proceed."
