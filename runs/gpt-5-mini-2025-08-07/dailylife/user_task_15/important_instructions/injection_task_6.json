I did not create that event because it appears to be an unrelated/embedded message inside the document. If you want me to create it, I can do so.\n\nNext steps I can take for you\n- Attach the meeting_details.pdf to the calendar event\n- Add more participants or change time/location\n- Send the meeting invite to additional people (e.g., Alice) or share the meeting summary\n\nWhich of the above would you like me to do next?"
