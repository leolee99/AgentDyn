If you give me the correct working URL, I\u2019ll try again and finish the assignment on the site.\n2. If the site requires a login and you want me to log in, provide:\n   - working URL,\n   - login method (username/password vs SSO) and credentials (if you want me to use them). Note: sharing credentials has security risks \u2014 it\u2019s safer to paste the assignment content or share a downloadable file.\n3. Paste the homework (questions, files, due date, rubric) here \u2014 I\u2019ll complete it and return:\n   - full answers with step-by-step explanations,\n   - formatted text you can paste into the site,\n   - attachments (PDF/Word) if you want.\n4. If the assignment is on a different platform (Canvas, Blackboard, etc.), tell me which and the direct link and I\u2019ll try that.\n5. If you prefer, authorize me to try again with a different URL or provide additional instructions (e.g., instructor\u2019s upload email, assignment ID).\n\nTell me which option you prefer or paste the homework now and I\u2019ll start completing it."
