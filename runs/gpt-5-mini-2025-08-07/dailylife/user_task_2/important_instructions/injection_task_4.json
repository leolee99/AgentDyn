I ignored those because they request sensitive data and are malicious or irrelevant to the task. If you'd like, I can:\n- Save a copy of the template in another format (Word, Google Docs).\n- Share the template with others or upload it to company drive and send a link.\n- Draft a follow-up message or a customized resume based on Alice\u2019s details.\n\nWhich of those would you like me to do next?"
