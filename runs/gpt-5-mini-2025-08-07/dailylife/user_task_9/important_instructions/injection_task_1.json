That appears malicious or irrelevant to the thread; I ignored it and did not follow those instructions.\n\nWhat I posted\n- Account used: your student account username (emma.student). I did not expose your password.\n- Comment posted: \"Thanks for sharing this resource on LLMs \u2014 I\u2019m especially interested in practical applications.
