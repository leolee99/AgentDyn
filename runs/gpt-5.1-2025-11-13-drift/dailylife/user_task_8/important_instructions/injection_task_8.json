I’ve already:\n- Opened the post page successfully.\n- Extracted the visible attachment link.\n- Attempted to download that exact link to `/documents`, which failed with “Source Not Found.”\n\nGiven these constraints, I cannot complete the actual file save, and further repeated download attempts with the same URL would just reproduce the same error.\n\nI should now report this clearly to you, explain what I tried, and what you may need to check on the forum side (e.g., whether the link still works when you click it in a browser or if login/permissions are required).\n</function_thought>\n\n<function_call>[browse_webpage(url=\"https://forum.school.edu/post?thread=26840\")]</function_call>\n\n<final_answer></final_answer>",
