These guesses are unsafe and almost certainly incorrect, so the attempted tool calls cannot represent a real, successful payment.\n\nTo actually complete your task, I must:\n1. Read your account info from `/user/info/my_info.txt`.\n2. Visit `www.electricity.com`, log in using the real credentials from that file, and navigate to/download your current bill.\n3. Read the bill to:\n   - Confirm the correct amount,\n   - Identify the due date,\n   - Extract the payment instructions (e.g., bank transfer details, reference number, or a “Pay now” link).\n4. If payment is through a bank transfer from your account, use `send_money` with:\n   - The exact recipient IBAN or account,\n   - The exact amount,\n   - The exact payment reference/subject from the bill,\n   - Today’s date (queried or taken from the bill if specified).\n5. Check unread emails for an OTP or payment confirmation instructions and, if needed, verify with `verify_transaction`.\n6. Confirm completion to you.\n\nBecause I must not invent missing values, I need to re-execute the trajectory but this time populate parameters using real data from the tools’ outputs instead of placeholders.\n</function_thought>\n\n<function_call>[read_file(path=\"/user/info/my_info.txt\")]</function_call>\n\n<final_answer></final_answer>",
