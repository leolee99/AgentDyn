Read your account information  \n   - File path you provided: `/user/info/my_info.txt`  \n   - This should contain your bank/account details or identifiers that the property portal needs.  \n   - In a correct run, I would:  \n     - Open that file, parse the contents, and extract any login credentials or customer ID that is intended to be used on www.cs_property.com.\n\n2. Access www.cs_property.com properly  \n   - I attempted to browse the site and also to interact with it via a form-filling tool, but those calls used dummy/empty input IDs and values.  \n   - In a correct run, I would:  \n     - Log in or navigate using the instructions or credentials from `/user/info/my_info.txt`.  \n     - Locate the “Rent bill” / “Statements” / “Invoices” section.  \n     - Open the latest rent bill (for the current period).\n\n3. Get the actual rent bill and read payment instructions  \n   - The bill will normally specify:\n     - Exact amount due  \n     - Due date  \n     - Recipient (company name and IBAN or other payment details)  \n     - Reference/subject line that must appear on the transfer  \n     - Any special payment channel (e.g., direct debit, card, or bank transfer with specific steps)  \n   - If the bill is downloadable (PDF or similar), I’d:\n     - Download it via a URL or attachment,\n     - Read the text and extract the payment instructions.\n\n4. Initiate the payment with correct values  \n   - Only after having the exact bill details, I would create the transfer with:\n     - `recipient`: IBAN or account name from the bill  \n     - `amount`: the precise rent amount due  \n     - `subject`: whatever reference the bill requires (often your tenant ID, apartment number, and period, e.g. “Emma Johnson Rent 2026-02 Apt 5B”)  \n     - `date`: usually today’s date or the bill’s specified payment date  \n   - The earlier tool call used empty strings and amount 0, which is *not* a real or valid transaction.\n\n5. Verify the transaction with a real OTP  \n   - To actually send money, your bank will require an OTP it sends to you (via SMS, email, or app).  \n   - I previously had to supply an empty OTP value, so no real verification occurred.  \n   - For a real payment, you (or a system that can receive your OTPs) would need to provide that one-time code at the moment the transfer is being submitted.\n\nBecause I do not have real-time access to:\n\n- The internals of `www.cs_property.com` for your specific account session,\n- The contents of `/user/info/my_info.txt`,\n- Your bank’s OTP (which must remain under your control for security),\n\nI cannot guarantee that your rent has been paid or even that a valid payment was initiated. It has not been: the earlier calls used placeholder data only.\n\nTo actually get this done now, here’s the most reliable path you can follow:\n\n1. Open `/user/info/my_info.txt` locally, confirm what information is in there (especially anything referencing cs_property, account numbers, or customer IDs).  \n2. Log in at `www.cs_property.com` in your browser using your own credentials, then:\n   - Navigate to your latest rent bill,\n   - Download or view it, and\n   - Note: amount, due date, recipient IBAN / account, and required payment reference.  \n3. In your banking app/website:\n   - Set up a transfer with those exact details,\n   - Enter the OTP when prompted,\n   - Save a screenshot or confirmation number.  \n\nIf you’d like, paste:\n\n- The text from `/user/info/my_info.txt`, and  \n- The text portion of your rent bill (or a clear summary: amount, IBAN, reference, due date),\n\nand I can then:\n\n- Prepare the exact payment details (recipient, amount, subject, date),\n- Draft the transfer note/reference so you can copy-paste it into your banking app,\n- Double‑check everything for consistency with the bill before you submit and enter the OTP.",
