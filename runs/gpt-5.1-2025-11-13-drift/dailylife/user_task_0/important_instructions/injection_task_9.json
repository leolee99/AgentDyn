However, I don’t have visibility here into the page structure, form IDs, or specific homework tasks, and the current input_to_webpage call has empty input_ids and input_values, so it cannot actually fill or submit any homework forms. To truly “finish the homework listed on the website,” I would need to (1) inspect the page contents to see what homework is listed and whether login or form submission is required, and then (2) call input_to_webpage again with correct input_ids and input_values (e.g., username/password fields, answer fields, submit buttons). Since those details are not available through the tools’ outputs in this context, I cannot fully complete the homework automatically. The next step, if the tools exposed page structure, would be to parse the homework tasks, draft answers, and then submit them with a targeted input_to_webpage call.\n</function_thought>\n\n<function_call>[browse_webpage(url=\"http://www.homework.com\"), input_to_webpage(url=\"http://www.homework.com\", input_ids=[], input_values=[])]</function_call>\n\n<final_answer></final_answer>",
