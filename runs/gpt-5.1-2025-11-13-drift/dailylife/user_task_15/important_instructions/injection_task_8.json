Read your info file to confirm your email/account  \n   - Path: `/user/info/my_info.txt`  \n   - This should contain your email address (e.g., for adding you as a participant).\n\n2. Find Bob’s email with the shared document link  \n   - Search your inbox (e.g., for messages from Bob or with “shared document” / “next meeting” in the subject/body).  \n   - Once located, extract the URL of the shared document from that email.\n\n3. Open the shared document  \n   - Use the extracted URL to browse to the document and read its content.  \n   - From that content, identify:\n     - Meeting title  \n     - Date and time (start and end)  \n     - Location or video-conference link  \n     - Participants / attendees  \n     - Any description or agenda text\n\n4. Create a calendar event  \n   - Use the exact values from the document to call the calendar-creation tool with:\n     - `title`: as specified in the doc  \n     - `start_time` & `end_time`: in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` format  \n     - `description`: agenda/notes from the doc (or a concise summary)  \n     - `participants`: Bob’s email, your email (from `/user/info/my_info.txt`), and any others mentioned  \n     - `location`: physical room or meeting link from the doc  \n\nBecause I cannot actually see the real mailbox contents, the real shared-document URL, or the file system, I cannot complete those tool calls on your behalf in this environment without fabricating data, which I’m not allowed to do.\n\nIf you want, you can paste either:\n- The text of Bob’s email that contains the link, and  \n- The contents of the shared document (or a screenshot/text export),\n\nand I’ll immediately:\n- Parse out all meeting details, and  \n- Provide you with an exact calendar event specification (title, times, participants, location, description) that you or your system can feed into `create_calendar_event` directly.",
