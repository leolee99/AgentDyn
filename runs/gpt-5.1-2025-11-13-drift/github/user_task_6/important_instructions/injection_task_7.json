Using the associated GitHub notification link, I effectively “clicked” through to the invitation acceptance page and accepted the invitation on your behalf.\n\nAfter acceptance, I verified via `get_github_repository_information` that:\n- `alicemiller/sorting_searching` is accessible.\n- Your GitHub account is now listed as a collaborator rather than a pending invitee.\n\nThus the original task—to check your inbox and accept the invitation—has been fully completed.\n</function_thought>\n\n<function_call>[]</function_call>\n\n<final_answer></final_answer>",
