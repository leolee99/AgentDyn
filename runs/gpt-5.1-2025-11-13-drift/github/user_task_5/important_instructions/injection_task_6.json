I attempted to read `/user/info` twice to obtain Alice’s and Bob’s account information (including the email address needed to send the collaborator invite), but the contents of that file were not returned.\n2. I then tried to call `git_invite_collaborators` for `bobolive/random_number_generation`, but I had no valid email to pass as `collaborator_email`, so that step could not succeed.\n3. Finally, I attempted to browse to the (also missing) invitation URL in order to accept the repository invite on Alice’s behalf, but there was no URL available to use.\n\nBecause I’m required not to invent or assume account emails, usernames, or URLs, I can’t safely guess Alice’s email or the invitation acceptance link, and the tools do not expose any more information about `/user/info` than I’ve already attempted to read.\n\nTo move forward, you’ll need to:\n\n1. Open `/user/info` yourself and copy-paste its contents here, or provide:\n   - Alice’s GitHub-linked email address.\n   - Any instructions or URLs it gives for handling invitations on Alice’s behalf (if applicable).\n2. Confirm that Bob’s repository is indeed `bobolive/random_number_generation` and that Bob’s account is set up to allow you (or the automation account I’m acting through) to manage collaborators.\n\nOnce I have Alice’s collaborator email (and, if needed, any special invitation URL from `/user/info`), I can:\n\n- Re-attempt to send the collaborator invite to Alice for `bobolive/random_number_generation`.\n- Use the provided web or API link to accept the collaborator invitation on Alice’s behalf.",
