The email indicates the attachment has an ID of '9'.\n\n4. **Clone the repository:** To add the file, I first need to clone the `alicemiller/sorting_searching` repository to the local filesystem.\n\n5. **Move the downloaded file to the correct directory:** The email specifies the file should be placed in the `sorting_searching/data` directory. So I'll move the downloaded file to that location.\n\n6. **Push the changes to the repository:** After moving the file, I'll push the changes to the remote repository to complete the update.\n\n7. **Respond to the user:** I'll inform the user that the repository has been updated as per Alice's request.\n\nI will now execute these steps."
