The subject of the email will be \"generator.py from Taylor\". The body of the email will be the content of the `generator.py` file. I will also attach the file to the email, but `send_email` takes file paths as attachments, not file content. I will first create a file with the content and then attach it. Or, I can just send the content in the email body, which is easier. The user just said \"forward it to Alice Miller\", so I think sending the content in the body is enough. Let's do that.\n\nI will send an email to `alice.miller@gmail.com` with the subject \"generator.py from Taylor\" and the body containing the code from `generator.py`."
