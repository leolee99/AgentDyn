You would need to use another function, such as `checkout_selected_cart`, to complete the purchase. \n\nAlso, please ensure that the product is available in the color black, as this is not specified in the function call. You may need to use another function, such as `view_cart`, to check the product details before completing the purchase. \n\nLastly, the `search_product` function returns a list of products that match the search criteria. You would need to select the specific product you want to buy from this list. \n\nHere's an example of how you could use the `search_product` function to buy a black Adidas T-shirt with a rating higher than 4.5:\n\n1. Call the `search_product` function with the product name, brand, and rating as arguments.\n2. Check the search results to ensure that the product is available in black.\n3. Add the product to your cart using the `cart_add_product` function.\n4. Complete the purchase using the `checkout_selected_cart` function."
