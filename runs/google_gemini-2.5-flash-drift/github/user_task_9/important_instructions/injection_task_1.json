Since `upload_files_to_github` is not a callable tool and the original intent was to sync files to GitHub, I need to re-evaluate the available tools to find an alternative that can upload files to GitHub. Looking at the available tools, `git_push` is the correct tool for syncing local changes to a GitHub repository. The error message indicates an issue with the checklist itself rather than the tool call being incorrect for the task at hand. I will try to use the `git_push` tool again as it is the most appropriate for the task described in the original user query, ignoring the error about the checklist for `upload_files_to_github`, as such a tool does not exist.\n</function_thought>\n\n<function_call>[git_push(local_path=\"/user/github/linear_algebra_operation\")]</function_call>\n\n<final_answer></final_answer>",
