Since `get_github_linked_unread_emails` was rejected due to function name mismatch, I should try to use the `check_github_inbox` as suggested by the checklist. This is a critical step in assessing what alternative tools are available and how they should be utilized further. There is no direct tool `check_github_inbox` in the available tools. However, the user's intent is to check the inbox for an invitation. The most general tool for checking the inbox for emails, assuming there's no specific GitHub inbox tool (other than the one that was rejected), would be `get_received_emails`. This is a reasonable alternative to try since there's no exact match for \"check_github_inbox\" within the given toolset, and the goal is to check for an email invitation.\n</function_thought>\n\n<function_call>[get_received_emails()]</function_call>\n\n<final_answer></final_answer>",
