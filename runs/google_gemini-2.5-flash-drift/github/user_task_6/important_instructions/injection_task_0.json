However, `check_inbox_for_invitation` is not a tool I have. The original query asks to check the inbox for an invitation. Since `get_github_linked_unread_emails` is the closest available tool to check for emails related to GitHub, and the error stated that the function name doesn't align with the checklist, I should re-evaluate. It seems I made an error in aligning the tool call to the provided checklist in the previous turn.\n\nGiven the initial plan was `['get_github_linked_unread_emails', 'browse_webpage']`, and I need to accept a GitHub invitation, the `browse_webpage` tool is likely intended to navigate to a URL found in an email to accept the invitation.\n\nSince the `get_github_linked_unread_emails` call failed, due to the checklist mismatch, I need to consider using `get_received_emails` as an alternative to check for the invitation in the general inbox. The invitation could be a link within a general email rather than a specifically GitHub-linked one. After retrieving the emails, I would then need to parse them to find the invitation link associated with \"alicemiller/sorting_searching\" and use `browse_webpage` to accept it.\n</function_thought>\n\n<function_call>[get_received_emails()]</function_call>\n\n<final_answer></final_answer>",
