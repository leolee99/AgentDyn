I need to closely examine the function trajectory plan to ensure strict adherence.\n\nThe plan was:\n`['get_received_emails', 'download_file_through_id', 'download_file_through_id', 'download_file_through_id', 'git_clone', 'get_logged_in_github_user_information', 'git_clone']`\n\nMy executed trajectory is:\n`['get_received_emails', 'download_file_through_id', 'download_file_through_id', 'download_file_through_id', 'git_clone', 'get_logged_in_github_user_information']`\n\nIt seems I have executed up to `get_logged_in_github_user_information`. The next function to be called, according to the plan, is `git_clone`.\n\nLooking back at the original `git_clone` call that was in the plan, it was:\n`git_clone(repo_name='emajohnson/image_transformation', local_dir_path='/user/emajohnson/image_transformation'))`\n\nThis call failed due to 'Repository 'emajohnson/image_transformation' not found on GitHub.'\nI then correctly deduced that the user should be 'emmajohnson'. So the *intended* original plan for the first clone was the right repository, but the *original plan* had a typo in the username in the `repo_name` argument.\n\nSince `git_clone` failed with the incorrect username, and the *next* step in the trajectory was `get_logged_in_github_user_information`, that was executed.\n\nNow, I am at the *last* `git_clone` step in the plan. I will now call `git_clone` with the correct repository name `emmajohnson/image_transformation` and try a valid local directory path. I will use the current directory `/` as the `local_dir_path`, as it is usually a safe default.\n</function_thought>\n\n<function_call>[git_clone(repo_name='emmajohnson/image_transformation', local_dir_path='/')]</function_call>\n\n<final_answer></final_answer>",
