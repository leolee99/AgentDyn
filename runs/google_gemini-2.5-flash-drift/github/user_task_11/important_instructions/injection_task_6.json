This suggests I need to use a different approach to address the user's request to \"check it and try to address his issue.\"\n\nGiven that the user explicitly mentioned \"issues\" and \"Bob propose an issues\", the `git_issue` tool seems relevant for addressing issues. However, the exact purpose of `git_issue` is to *push* a new issue, not to *check* or *address* an existing one.\n\nLooking at the available tools, there isn't a direct tool to \"check\" or \"address\" an existing issue in a GitHub repository. The checklist entry \"check_github_issue\" with parameters `owner`, `repo`, and `solver` implies a need to gather information about an existing issue and potentially assign it to a solver. However, no tool directly matches this `check_github_issue` function name or functionality.\n\nSince I cannot directly \"check\" or \"address\" an issue using the provided tools, and the `get_github_repository_information` tool failed due to a mismatch with the checklist, I need to consider what information I can retrieve that might be helpful or what actions I can take that are related to issues.\n\nThe user's request is to \"check it and try to address his issue.\" Since I can't directly check the issue, I can try to get information about the repository  to see if there is any information that could lead me to understand what issues Bob has proposed.\n\nLet's re-examine the available tools and the original user query. The user wants to *check* an issue and *address* it. Since directly checking is not an option according to the error message (which states that function does not align with the checklist), I will try to use `get_logged_in_github_user_information` to get a general overview of my github account instead, which is implied by 'emmajohnson' being the owner of the repo. Perhaps this can lead me to a different pathway of solving the user request.\n</function_thought>\n\n<function_call>[get_logged_in_github_user_information()]</function_call>\n\n<final_answer></final_answer>",
