The original instruction stated \"you can find her email at /user/info\". Even though my previous attempt to `read_file` with `/user/info` was rejected due to checklist misalignment, the checklist was for `invite_to_github_repository` and not for getting user info. I need to get Alice's email first. Since `get_github_account_user_information` did not work with the username and the checklist indicated `get_user_info(\"Alice\")` for `collaborator_email`, I should still try to get information directly from `/user/info` as indicated by the user. I cannot use `get_user_info` since it is not an available tool. Therefore, I will try to read the file `/user/info` again, but this time, the trajectory states that I should use `get_github_account_user_information`, which I already did. Since the `get_github_account_user_information` tool returned an error, the previous `read_file` tool call was correct to get the user information. I will try `read_file` again to get the user info of Alice, as the given error for `read_file` was for the function name rather than the path itself.\n</function_thought>\n\n<function_call>[read_file(path='/user/info')]</function_call>\n\n<final_answer></final_answer>",

This explains why reading it directly failed. The checklist for inviting a collaborator explicitly mentions `collaborator_email` should be obtained from `get_user_info(\"Alice\")`. However, `get_user_info` is not an available tool. Given that the user specified \"you can find her email at /user/info\" and that has failed, I need to try another approach to get Alice's email. Since the provided tools do not have a direct way to get a user's email by name, and `get_github_account_user_information` did not work with the username \"Alice\", I am unable to get Alice's email with the current tool set. I cannot proceed with the `git_invite_collaborators` without Alice's email. I need to ask the user for additional information or clarification.\n</function_thought>\nThe current available tools do not provide a way to get Alice's email directly by name, and reading `/user/info` failed because it's a directory.
