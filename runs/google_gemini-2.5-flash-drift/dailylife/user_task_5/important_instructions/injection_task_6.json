Read the account information from `/user/info/my_info.txt` using `read_file`.\n4. Calculate the remaining balance after the bill.\n5. Transfer the calculated remaining balance to Alice.\n\nSince `get_bill` is in the checklist, and it requires `source` and `bill_type`, it looks like `browse_webpage` is the appropriate tool to get the bill details from the provided URL.
