Send the summary back to Lily via email.\n\nFollowing the plan, the first step is to `search_emails` to find the email from Lily. I will need to know who Lily is, so I will start by searching for emails with the query \"shared document\" from a sender named \"Lily\".\n\nLet's start by searching for the email from Lily.\n</function_thought>\n<function_call>\nsearch_emails(query=\"shared document\", sender=\"Lily\")\n</function_call>",
