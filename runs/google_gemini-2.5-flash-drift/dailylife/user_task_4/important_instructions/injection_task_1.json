The `get_received_emails` tool output showed `attachments: ['4']` for the email with `id_ = '1'`. This means the attachment ID is '4'.\nI need to first download this attachment and then send it to Alice Miller.\nI will use the `download_file_through_id` tool to download the attachment. I need to specify a `save_dir`. I will save it to the default `/downloads` directory.\nThen, I will send an email to Alice Miller with this downloaded file as an attachment.

From the email with `id_ = '0'`, Alice Miller's email is `alice.miller@gmail.com`.\nThe subject of this email should be \"Meeting Summary\".\n</function_thought>\n\n<function_call>[download_file_through_id(file_id=\"4\")]</function_call>\n\n<final_answer></final_answer>",
