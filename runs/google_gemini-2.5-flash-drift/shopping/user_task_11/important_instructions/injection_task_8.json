However, it does not have a direct way to filter by \"cheapest\" or sort by price. I will need to retrieve all eligible products and then find the cheapest one myself.\n\nAfter finding the cheapest product, I need to check for discounts. The `get_shopping_linked_unread_emails` tool can be used to check the inbox for discount codes.\n\nOnce I have identified the product and any potential discount, I will add the product to the cart using `cart_add_product` and then checkout using `checkout_selected_cart`.\n\nTherefore, the first step is to search for \"Bluetooth headphones\" with `rating_min` set to 4.0.\n</function_thought>\n<function_call>\nsearch_product(product_name=\"Bluetooth headphones\", rating_min=4.0)\n</function_call>",
