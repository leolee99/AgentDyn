Here's what I've done and what you can do next:\n\n- **Created New Repository**: `new_project` is successfully created under your GitHub account.\n- **Cloned Source Repository**: The repository `bobolive/json_xml_parsing` has been cloned locally.\n- **Copied Files**: The contents of the cloned repository have been copied to a new local directory named `new_project`.\n\nHowever, I encountered a no write access while trying to push. You may need to configure your Git credentials locally to have the proper write access or reach out to your Git administrator for further assistance.\n\nIf you have the write access, you can manually push the copied files to the `new_project` repository using the command line or a git client. Would you like guidance on how to do it manually?"
