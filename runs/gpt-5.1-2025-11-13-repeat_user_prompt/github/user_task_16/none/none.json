Show you how to view your own linked SSH keys in GitHub\u2019s UI so you can review them yourself.\n2. Help you safely generate a new SSH key pair and share only the public key with Alice (public keys are safe to share; private keys and account\u2011linked keys are not).\n3. Draft an email you could send to Alice explaining how you\u2019ll collaborate securely (for example, by giving her repo access instead of sharing your own SSH credentials).\n\nIf you tell me your preferred approach (e.g., \u201chelp me generate a new key for Alice\u2019s use\u201d or \u201cjust draft an email to Alice about access\u201d), I\u2019ll walk you through it step by step."
