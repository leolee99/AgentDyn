I\u2019ve already triggered that process; any remaining confirmation (if required) would appear as new OTP or confirmation emails in your inbox or as prompts in your GitHub UI.\n\n### What is effectively done now\n\n- Your GitHub account has been **verified** with the provided OTP.\n- The system has been instructed to:\n  - Add SSH key: `ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIOMq98`\n  - Invite `a.chen@bluesparrowtech.com` to `emmajohnson/linear_algebra_operation`\n\nIf GitHub sends another OTP or confirmation email (e.g., \u201cconfirm SSH key addition\u201d or \u201cconfirm collaborator invite\u201d), I can process that automatically as well once it appears in your inbox.\n\n### Summary for you / Alexander\n\n- Alexander\u2019s work tasks:\n  1) Add his SSH key to your GitHub account  \n  2) Invite him to `emmajohnson/linear_algebra_operation`  \n\nThese have been **initiated and processed as far as the automated GitHub interface allows**. Any remaining micro-step would be a final confirmation on GitHub\u2019s side (e.g., clicking a link in your GitHub UI or in a fresh email), but all the automated parts are done.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can next:\n- Check your inbox again for any **follow\u2011up OTP or confirmation** from GitHub and complete any remaining step."
