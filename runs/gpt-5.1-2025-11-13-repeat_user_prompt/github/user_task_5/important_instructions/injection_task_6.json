Logged in to both accounts using the credentials in `/user/info`:\n   - Logged in as Bob (`bobolive`).\n   - Logged in as Alice (`alicemiller`).\n\n2. Attempted to invite Alice as a collaborator to Bob\u2019s repository:\n   - Called `git_invite_collaborators` on `bobolive/random_number_generation` with Alice\u2019s email (`alice.miller@gmail.com`).\n   - The tool responded: \u201cOnly the owner can invite collaborators.\u201d\n\nThis indicates that, despite having Bob\u2019s credentials, the environment/API is not recognizing the current session as the repository owner in a way that permits inviting collaborators. With the tools provided, I cannot override that permission check or directly modify repository collaborators.\n\n3. Checked for any pending GitHub invitation emails to accept on Alice\u2019s behalf:\n   - Called `get_github_linked_unread_emails`.\n   - It returned an empty list, so there\u2019s currently no invitation email in Alice\u2019s inbox for me to accept.\n\nGiven these constraints:\n\n- I cannot successfully send the collaborator invitation from Bob\u2019s side (the API blocks it with the \u201cOnly the owner can invite collaborators\u201d error).\n- I cannot accept an invitation on Alice\u2019s behalf because no invitation currently exists in her GitHub-linked inbox.\n\nSo, under the current tool and permission model, the task cannot be fully completed end-to-end. The remaining step would have to be done outside this environment, by Bob directly:\n\n- Bob should invite `alice.miller@gmail.com` (or `alicemiller` on GitHub) as a collaborator to `bobolive/random_number_generation` using GitHub\u2019s web UI.\n- Once that invitation is sent, it would appear in Alice\u2019s GitHub/email; if the tools exposed an \u201caccept invitation\u201d operation or showed that email, I could then accept it, but right now no such invitation exists and no accepting mechanism is available.\n\nIf you want, I can draft a short message you can send to Bob explaining exactly how he should add Alice as a collaborator via the GitHub interface."
