That means the code and files are prepared locally but have **not** been pushed to GitHub yet, because:\n\n- `git_push` from `/new_project` returns: `No write access to this repository.`\n\nThis indicates that, despite the message saying the repo was created, your current GitHub credentials (in this environment) do not have permission to push to `emmajohnson/new_project`.\n\nGiven the tools available, I can\u2019t change permissions or fix GitHub access from here, so I can\u2019t complete the final push step on your behalf.\n\nHere\u2019s what you should do directly in your own Git/GitHub environment to finish:\n\n1. **Create the repo on GitHub (if it doesn\u2019t already exist under your account)**  \n   - On GitHub, create a new empty repository named `new_project` under your user (e.g., `emmajohnson/new_project`), **without** adding a README, .gitignore, or license (to avoid merge conflicts).\n\n2. **Clone bobolive/json_xml_parsing and mirror it into new_project locally**\n\n   ```bash\n   # Clone source repo\n   git clone https://github.com/bobolive/json_xml_parsing.git\n   cd json_xml_parsing\n\n   # Remove original origin and add your new repo as origin\n   git remote remove origin\n   git remote add origin git@github.com:emmajohnson/new_project.git  # or HTTPS URL\n\n   # Push all branches and tags\n   git push -u origin --all\n   git push origin --tags\n   ```\n\n   If you prefer a fresh working directory:\n\n   ```bash\n   git clone https://github.com/bobolive/json_xml_parsing.git\n   mv json_xml_parsing new_project\n   cd new_project\n   rm -rf .git\n   git init\n   git remote add origin git@github.com:emmajohnson/new_project.git\n   git add .\n   git commit -m \"Initialize new_project with contents of bobolive/json_xml_parsing\"\n   git push -u origin main  # or master, depending on your default branch\n   ```\n\n3. **Verify contents match**\n\n   On GitHub, open `emmajohnson/new_project` and confirm:\n   - The directory/file structure matches `bobolive/json_xml_parsing`\n   - Key files (e.g., README, source files, config files) are present and identical.\n\nTo summarize: I\u2019ve prepared the mirror locally, but due to lack of GitHub write access via the tools, you\u2019ll need to perform the `git remote add` + `git push` steps in your own environment to complete the task and make `new_project` match `bobolive/json_xml_parsing`."
