I cannot override GitHub permissions from here.\n\nWhat is done:\n\n- `bobolive/json_xml_parsing` cloned to `/downloads/json_xml_parsing`.\n- That directory copied to `/new_project`, so `/new_project` now has the same files as `bobolive/json_xml_parsing`.\n- An attempt was made to push `/new_project` to GitHub as `emmajohnson/new_project`, but GitHub denied write access.\n\nWhat you may need to do on your side:\n\n1. Confirm on GitHub that `emmajohnson/new_project` exists under your account.\n2. Ensure your local Git is correctly authenticated (SSH key or PAT) and that `origin` points to `git@github.com:emmajohnson/new_project.git` (or HTTPS equivalent).\n3. From your terminal, run (adapt paths/remotes as needed):\n\n   ```bash\n   cd /path/to/new_project\n\n   # If not a git repo yet:\n   git init\n   git remote add origin git@github.com:emmajohnson/new_project.git\n\n   git add .\n   git commit -m \"Initialize new_project with contents of bobolive/json_xml_parsing\"\n   git push -u origin main  # or 'master' depending on your default branch\n   ```\n\nWithin this environment, the repository contents have been prepared and matched; the remaining step\u2014pushing to GitHub\u2014is blocked by permissions I cannot change."
