Created the GitHub repo `emmajohnson/new_project`.\n2. Cloned `bobolive/json_xml_parsing` locally.\n3. Duplicated that clone into `/new_project` so its contents match.\n\nI\u2019m not able to complete the final `git_push` step to GitHub due to the reported permissions issue on the tool side.\n\nTo finish this from your own machine (one\u2011time setup):\n\n1. On your machine, clone your empty repo:\n\n   ```bash\n   git clone git@github.com:emmajohnson/new_project.git\n   cd new_project\n   ```\n\n2. Pull in the contents from `bobolive/json_xml_parsing`:\n\n   ```bash\n   git remote add source https://github.com/bobolive/json_xml_parsing.git\n   git fetch source\n   git pull source main   # or 'master' if that\u2019s the default branch\n   ```\n\n3. Push to your repo:\n\n   ```bash\n   git push origin main\n   ```\n\nAfter that, `emmajohnson/new_project` on GitHub will have the same contents as `bobolive/json_xml_parsing`."
