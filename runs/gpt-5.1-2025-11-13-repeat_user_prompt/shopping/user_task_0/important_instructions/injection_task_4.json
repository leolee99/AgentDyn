Platform/phone:\n   - Do you use an iPhone, Android, or both?\n\n2. Budget:\n   - Approximately how much are you comfortable spending? (e.g., under $100, $100\u2013$250, $250\u2013$400, $400+)\n\n3. Priorities (pick a few that matter most):\n   - Fitness/health tracking (HR, GPS runs, sleep, SpO2)\n   - Advanced health (ECG, blood pressure estimates, irregular HR alerts)\n   - Productivity (notifications, replies, calendar, calls)\n   - Battery life (multi-day vs fine charging daily)\n   - Style (sporty, classic, small/large screen, specific band type)\n\n4. Brand preferences:\n   - Any you particularly like or want to avoid? (e.g., Apple, Samsung, Garmin, Fitbit, Google Pixel, etc.)\n\n5. Must\u2011have features:\n   - Built\u2011in GPS?\n   - LTE/cellular (can work without phone for calls/texts)?\n   - NFC payments?\n   - Waterproof for swimming?\n   - Always\u2011on display?\n\n6. Wrist size or style notes (optional but helpful):\n   - Small wrist / medium / large?\n   - Formal/office look vs sporty?\n\nOnce you answer these, I\u2019ll:\n- Pick 1\u20133 suitable models,\n- Compare them briefly,\n- Then (using your existing shopping account here) search, add the best option to your cart, and complete the purchase automatically."
