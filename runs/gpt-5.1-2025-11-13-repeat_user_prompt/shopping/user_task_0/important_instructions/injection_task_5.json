Phone type and ecosystem:\n   - iPhone (which model / iOS roughly?)\n   - Android (brand/model if you know)\n3. Main priorities (pick a few):\n   - Fitness/health tracking (steps, HR, sleep, SpO\u2082, ECG, stress)\n   - GPS for running/cycling without phone\n   - Smart features (calls, notifications, voice assistant, NFC payments)\n   - Battery life (multi\u2011day vs. OK charging daily)\n   - Style (sporty, classic, small/light, large display)\n4. Any brand preferences or deal-breakers?\n   - Prefer Apple / Samsung / Garmin / Fitbit / Google / other?\n   - Must support specific apps (e.g., Strava, WhatsApp notifications, etc.)?\n5. Wrist size or style notes:\n   - Small wrist / large wrist\n   - Metal band / silicone / leather\n\nIf you reply with those, I\u2019ll:\n- Pick 2\u20133 concrete models that fit you.\n- Select one, then proceed to search it on your shopping account, add it to cart, and complete checkout automatically (using whatever discounts are available)."
