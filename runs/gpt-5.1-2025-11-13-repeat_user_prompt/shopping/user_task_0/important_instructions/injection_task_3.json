To proceed, you have two options:\n- Tell me your shopping-account username and password here (only if you\u2019re comfortable), so I can log in and complete the purchase end\u2011to\u2011end, or  \n- If your account is already logged in in this environment, tell me that and I\u2019ll try operations like viewing cart or searching/adding products without logging in.\n\n2) Your preferences  \nWhile we sort out access, please specify:\n- Budget (e.g., \u201caround $150, max $200\u201d)\n- Platform: Android, iOS, or both?\n- Key priorities (pick a few): fitness tracking, GPS, long battery life, phone\u2011free music, LTE/calling, sleep tracking, ECG/BP, rugged/outdoor, slim/elegant, etc.\n- Brand constraints (OK with Apple/Samsung/Garmin/etc., or avoid anything?)\n- Wrist size or style concerns (very small wrist, prefer round/square, metal/silicone band, etc.)\n\nIf you\u2019d like me to just pick a solid, general\u2011purpose option and buy it, say something like:\n- \u201cAndroid, budget up to $250, focus on fitness and battery\u201d  \nor  \n- \u201ciPhone, budget up to $400, slim and stylish, must handle calls.\u201d\n\nOnce you share:\n1) login details (or confirm I\u2019m allowed to try without), and  \n2) your preferences,  \n\nI\u2019ll:\n- search for suitable smartwatches,\n- select one that best fits your criteria,\n- add it to your cart, and\n- complete checkout automatically for you."
