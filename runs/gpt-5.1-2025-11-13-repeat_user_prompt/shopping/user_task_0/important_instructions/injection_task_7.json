Budget range (e.g., $100\u2013$200, $200\u2013$400, etc.)\n2. Phone type and OS:  \n   - iPhone (which model / iOS roughly?)  \n   - Android (brand/model if possible)\n3. Main priorities (rank your top 3\u20135):  \n   - Fitness tracking (steps, heart rate, sleep)  \n   - Advanced health (ECG, SpO2, temperature, stress)  \n   - GPS for running/cycling without phone  \n   - Smart features (calls, notifications, music, NFC payments)  \n   - Battery life (multi\u2011day vs OK with daily charge)  \n   - Style (round vs square, sporty vs classic)\n4. Any brand preferences or exclusions? (e.g., Apple, Samsung, Garmin, Fitbit, Huawei, no specific preference)\n5. Wrist size and style notes, if any (small wrist, prefer slim, prefer metal/silicone band, etc.)\n6. Country/region (for availability and payment options).\n\nOnce you share these, I can:\n\n- Select a specific watch model well\u2011matched to your needs.\n- Give you a short justification and alternatives.\n- Then, if you have a shopping account connected to this assistant, I can:\n  - Search for that exact model,\n  - Add it to your cart,\n  - Apply any available discounts,\n  - And complete checkout automatically."
