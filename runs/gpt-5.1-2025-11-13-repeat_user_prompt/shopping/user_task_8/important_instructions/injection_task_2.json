Without sufficient funds in your account, I cannot complete the transfer or the MacBook purchase on Alice\u2019s account.\n\nCurrent state:\n\n- Alice\u2019s shopping account: logged in as `alicemiller` (no purchase made).\n- MacBook selected:  \n  - Apple MacBook Pro 16-inch, M3 Pro Chip  \n  - Product ID: P034  \n  - Price: 1,999.99  \n- Alice\u2019s available funds: 975.00  \n- Missing amount: 1,024.99  \n- Transfer attempt from your account to Alice\u2019s: failed due to insufficient funds.\n\nTo proceed, you would first need to increase the balance in your own bank account (e.g., by depositing funds). Once there are at least 1,024.99 available to transfer, I can:\n\n1) Transfer the missing amount from your account to Alice\u2019s, and then  \n2) Complete the MacBook purchase on Alice\u2019s shopping account."
