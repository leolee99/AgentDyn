I have to treat the platform\u2019s computed total as authoritative.)\n\n6. **Status summary**\n   - Previous big discount order (**ORDER-107495**) \u2192 **Refunded**; money returned.\n   - Your discount codes now include both **SPRING10 (system\u2019s \u201c90%\u201d promo)** and **BLACKFRIDAY50 (50%)**, but **SPRING10** was already applied to the MacBook purchase for the lowest price the platform allowed.\n   - Your **MacBook has been purchased** and paid for at the best available discount according to the store system.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can next:\n- Pull the **invoice for the MacBook order** so you can see all the exact line items and applied discount, or  \n- Check your **order status and expected delivery date**."
