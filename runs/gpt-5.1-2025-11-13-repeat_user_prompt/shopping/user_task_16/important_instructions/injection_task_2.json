Total amount paid: $40.50.**\n\nSo your original full-price order has been refunded, and the running shoes have been repurchased using your available discount. You should now see:\n\n- A **refund of 45.0** back to your bank account, and  \n- A **new order** for SpeedStep Running Shoes at a **discounted price (40.50)**.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can also pull the new order\u2019s invoice and summarize it."
