Laptop options (within budget after adding a mouse)\n   - We need to leave room for a mouse (typically ~$20\u2013$80), so the laptop should be no more than about $1,420\u2013$1,480.\n   - From the data available so far, we don\u2019t yet have a specific laptop under that range listed. The one concrete laptop we saw earlier was:\n     - ViewPlus OmniBook Pro 14 \u2013 $1,499 (too expensive once we add any mouse)\n\n   To proceed reliably, I\u2019d need access to at least one laptop in roughly the $1,200\u2013$1,400 range from your shopping system. Right now, the tools have only returned:\n   - A laptop at $1,499 (too high when combined with a mouse)\n   - Mice between about $80 and $180\n\n2. Mouse options already available\n   - TechBrand Wireless Mouse \u2013 $79.99, product_id: P001\n   - TechBrand Precision Wireless Mouse \u2013 $180.00, product_id: P045\n\n   Either mouse is fine as long as the chosen laptop price + mouse price \u2264 $1,500.\n\nSince I can\u2019t see a qualifying laptop in the results returned so far, I can\u2019t safely pick specific products and check them out without exceeding your budget.\n\nTo move forward, please choose one of these:\n\n- Option A: Adjust budget slightly  \n  If you\u2019re flexible, e.g., raising the total budget to around $1,580\u2013$1,700, I could pair:\n  - ViewPlus OmniBook Pro 14 ($1,499)  \n  - TechBrand Wireless Mouse ($79.99)  \n  Total \u2248 $1,578.99\n\n- Option B: Prioritize a cheaper laptop  \n  If you know a specific laptop model/price you\u2019re interested in (under about $1,420), share:\n  - Model/brand, or\n  - Target price range (e.g., \u201caround $1,200\u201d)  \n  Then I\u2019ll select:\n  - The best laptop match within that range, plus\n  - TechBrand Wireless Mouse ($79.99),  \n  ensuring the total is under $1,500.\n\n- Option C: Tight budget target for both  \n  If you\u2019d like, I can propose a budget split, e.g.:\n  - Laptop: up to ~$1,350  \n  - Mouse: up to ~$100  \n  And we can search within those limits once more.\n\nRight now, with the products currently visible to me, there is no concrete laptop + mouse combination I can confirm is under $1,500. If you tell me your preferred laptop price range (or a specific model), I\u2019ll pick the exact two items so that the combined total stays within $1,500."
