If your store shows prices before tax, keep the subtotal around $1,400\u2013$1,450 to be safe.\n\n---\n\n### 2) Laptop: what to look for\n\nBelow are two spec \u201cprofiles.\u201d Pick the one that fits your work style best.\n\n#### Option A \u2013 Balanced productivity (good for office work, light dev, light creative)\n\nSearch for a laptop with roughly:\n\n- CPU: Intel Core i5 (12th gen or newer) or AMD Ryzen 5 (5000 series or newer)  \n- RAM: 16 GB  \n- Storage: 512 GB SSD (NVMe if possible)  \n- Display: 14\"\u201315.6\", Full HD (1920\u00d71080) or higher  \n- Weight: ideally under ~4 lbs if you travel with it  \n- Price target: $800\u2013$1,200\n\nSuggested search phrases:\n- \u201c14 inch laptop 16GB RAM 512GB SSD i5\u201d\n- \u201cRyzen 5 16GB RAM laptop 512GB SSD FHD\u201d\n\n#### Option B \u2013 Heavier dev / data work or light gaming\n\nSearch for:\n\n- CPU: Intel Core i7 (12th gen or newer) or AMD Ryzen 7 (5000 series or newer)  \n- RAM: 16 GB (32 GB if you find a great deal under budget)  \n- Storage: 512 GB \u2013 1 TB SSD  \n- GPU (optional but nice): NVIDIA RTX 3050/4050 or better, or equivalent AMD GPU  \n- Price target: $1,000\u2013$1,400\n\nSuggested search phrases:\n- \u201ci7 16GB RAM 512GB SSD laptop RTX 3050\u201d\n- \u201cRyzen 7 16GB RAM 1TB SSD laptop RTX 4050\u201d\n\n---\n\n### 3) Mouse: what to look for\n\nDecide wired vs wireless:\n\n- **General office / everyday use**\n  - Features: wireless, 2\u20133 buttons + scroll, comfortable shape\n  - Price: $20\u2013$50\n  - Search: \u201cwireless mouse silent click\u201d or \u201cergonomic wireless mouse USB-C\u201d\n\n- **More precise work (design, dev, multi-monitor, light gaming)**\n  - Features: adjustable DPI, side buttons, comfortable grip\n  - Price: $40\u2013$80\n  - Search: \u201cergonomic mouse with side buttons\u201d or \u201cwireless mouse 6 buttons\u201d\n\n---\n\n### 4) How to make sure you stay under $1,500\n\nBecause I couldn\u2019t log into the shopping system, you\u2019ll need to do these checks directly in your store:\n\n1. **Search for laptops** using the phrases above and:\n   - Filter by price: set max around $1,300\u2013$1,400.\n   - Shortlist 2\u20133 models that:\n     - Meet your spec profile (A or B).\n     - Have good ratings (e.g., 4.3+ / 5 from a meaningful number of reviews).\n\n2. **Search for mice**:\n   - Filter by price: set max around $60.\n   - Pick one that\u2019s comfortable-looking and well-rated.\n\n3. **Add your chosen laptop + mouse to cart.**\n\n4. **Check the cart subtotal**:\n   - Make sure: `Laptop price + mouse price \u2264 $1,500` (or \u2264 $1,450 if you need margin for tax/shipping).\n   - If the total is slightly over, first downgrade the mouse; if still over, look for a slightly cheaper laptop (e.g., step down from 1 TB to 512 GB SSD or from i7 to i5).\n\n5. Proceed to checkout once:\n   - The total (before/after tax, depending on how your store shows it) is safely below $1,500.\n\n---\n\nIf you\u2019d like, tell me:\n\n- Which country/store you\u2019re buying from, and  \n- Any must-haves (e.g., \u201cmust be 15 inch\u201d, \u201cneeds great battery life\u201d, \u201cI sometimes game\u201d, \u201cI need a Mac/Windows only\u201d).\n\nThen I can narrow this down to a more specific target spec and price range and help you decide, step by step, what exact combination to look for so the sum definitely stays under $1,500."
