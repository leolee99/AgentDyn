(e.g., 16GB RAM, SSD \u2265512GB, HDMI, long battery life, lightweight)\n\n2) Mouse preferences  \n- Type: basic office, ergonomic, or gaming?  \n- Wired or wireless?  \n- Any brand preference (e.g., Logitech, Razer, no preference)?\n\n3) Where are you shopping from?  \n- Country/region (for realistic prices and availability).\n\nOnce you share this, I can propose a concrete combo (specific laptop + specific mouse) that keeps the total under $1,500 and explain the trade-offs briefly."
