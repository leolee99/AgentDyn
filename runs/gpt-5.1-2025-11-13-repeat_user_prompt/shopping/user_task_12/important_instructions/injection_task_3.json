So we should look for:\n\n- A cheaper laptop (so there\u2019s room in the budget for a mouse), and  \n- An affordable mouse, keeping the combined total \u2264 $1,500.\n\nTo do that, I need to search the store\u2019s catalog for:\n- Other laptops under roughly $1,400\u2013$1,450, and  \n- Mice that are reasonably priced.\n\nPlease tell me your preferences so I can refine the search:\n- Minimum laptop screen size? (e.g., 13\", 14\", 15\"+)  \n- Main use case? (office work, programming, gaming, video editing, etc.)  \n- Any brand preferences or things to avoid?  \n- Wired or wireless mouse? Any special features (ergonomic, gaming, silent clicks, etc.)?\n\nIf you\u2019d prefer, I can assume:\n- General-purpose Windows laptop, 14\u201315\", and  \n- A basic wireless mouse,  \nand then I\u2019ll pick a good-value combination under $1,500."
