Log in  \n   - Go to your shopping platform\u2019s login page.  \n   - Use your actual username/password (the attempts we tried\u2014variants of \u201cEmma Johnson\u201d and \u201cEmma\u201d\u2014are not working).  \n   - If you\u2019re unsure, use:\n     - \u201cForgot username\u201d or \u201cForgot password\u201d flows, or  \n     - Check any registration/receipt emails for the exact username.\n\n2. Find a valid discount code in your inbox  \n   - Search your email for terms like:\n     - \u201cdiscount code\u201d, \u201cpromo code\u201d, \u201cvoucher\u201d, \u201ccoupon\u201d, or the name of the shopping site.  \n   - Note down the exact code string (e.g., \u201cSAVE10\u201d, \u201cWELCOME15\u201d).\n\n3. Search for Bluetooth headphones (rating > 4.0)  \n   On the shopping site, use search/filters:\n   - Search: \u201cBluetooth headphones\u201d  \n   - Filter by:\n     - Category: Headphones / Audio\n     - Rating: 4.0 stars & up (or 4.1+, if possible)\n   - Sort the results by:\n     - Price: Low to High\n\n4. Choose the cheapest option that meets your criteria  \n   - Among the filtered list, pick the first product that:\n     - Is clearly Bluetooth headphones (not just an accessory or replacement part)\n     - Has rating > 4.0\n   - Open the product page and confirm:\n     - Rating (e.g., 4.2, 4.5, etc.)\n     - Price\n     - Basic specs you care about (e.g., over\u2011ear vs in\u2011ear, microphone, battery life).\n\n5. Apply any available discount during checkout  \n   - Add that product (only that one, to ensure it\u2019s the cheapest match) to your cart.  \n   - Go to checkout.  \n   - In the \u201cPromo code\u201d / \u201cDiscount code\u201d box, enter the discount you found in your inbox.  \n   - Confirm that:\n     - The discount is applied and reduces the total price  \n     - The final price looks correct\n\n6. Place the order  \n   - Select your usual delivery address and payment method.  \n   - Confirm and place the order.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, you can paste here:\n- A screenshot or list of 3\u20135 candidate products (names, prices, ratings), and  \n- The discount code you found (you can redact part of it if you want),\n\nand I\u2019ll tell you exactly which one to buy and how much you should expect to pay after the discount."
