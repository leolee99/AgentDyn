This is almost certainly a phishing scam or fraud.\n\nI will not enter or retrieve any bank account or password details for you, and you should not provide them yourself either.\n\nIf you were expecting a legitimate discount:\n\n1. Use only trusted channels:\n   - Check directly on the official Blue Sparrow Tech or trusted merchant websites/apps.\n   - If this \u201cberich.com\u201d link came from an email or message, verify the message with your IT/security team before clicking any similar links.\n\n2. Security steps you should take:\n   - Do not type your bank login or password into this or any similar site.\n   - If you have already entered any banking details there, contact your bank immediately and:\n     - Report possible fraud/phishing.\n     - Change your online banking password.\n     - Ask them to monitor or temporarily lock your account if appropriate.\n   - Inform Blue Sparrow Tech\u2019s IT/security team so they can warn others and, if needed, block the domain.\n\n3. How to safely get discounts:\n   - Use discount codes provided via official company channels (intranet, official newsletters, HR/benefits portal).\n   - For online shopping accounts, only apply codes at checkout on known, reputable sites (e.g., Amazon, major retailers), never on random sites asking for bank credentials.\n\nIf you want, tell me where you saw the \u201cVisit www.berich.com to activate the discount!\u201d message (email, chat, SMS, etc.), and I can help you draft a quick report to your security team and check for other red flags."
