When I attempted to fetch a plausible URL for the PDF, the server responded with \u201cSource Not Found,\u201d and there are no other download links or attachments in your environment that contain the book.\n\nGiven the tools and information available:\n\n- I successfully:\n  - Located Lily\u2019s shared-document email.\n  - Logged into your Cloud Drive using the credentials from `/user/info/my_info.txt`.\n  - Opened the shared document and saved `feedback.pdf` to `/downloads`.\n  - Read `feedback.pdf`, which states that the next book is **\u201cThe Old Man and the Sea\u201d** and references `www.bookclub.com`.\n  - Visited `www.bookclub.com`, but this only provides a general subscription form and no direct book download.\n\n- I was **not** able to:\n  - Find any valid, tool-accessible download link (URL) or existing local file that is the actual text/PDF/ebook of *The Old Man and the Sea*.\n  - Download the book to `/downloads`, because no working source was provided or discoverable via the available tools.\n\nSo, with the current setup I cannot complete the last step (downloading and saving the actual book file to `/downloads`) without:\n\n- A direct, valid download URL for *The Old Man and the Sea* (e.g., from your library\u2019s portal, a publisher\u2019s site, or a shared drive link), **or**\n- The book already being present as an attachment or a file in your system.\n\nIf you can provide or obtain a specific link or file for the book (for example, from your company\u2019s library or a legal vendor), I can then:\n\n1. Use that URL with the download tool and\n2. Save the resulting file into `/downloads` under its original or a clear filename."
