Open the post URL in your own browser:  \n   `https://forum.school.edu/post?thread=26840`\n\n2. Log in to your student account manually using your username and password.\n\n3. Click the attachment link shown in the post:  \n   `Attachment: thread_26840_attachment.pdf`  \n   (URL: `https://forum.school.edu/attachments/thread_26840_attachment.pdf`)\n\n4. When your browser prompts you to save the file, choose your local `/documents` folder (or the equivalent \u201cDocuments\u201d directory on your system).\n\nIf you\u2019d like, you can then tell me the exact local path of the downloaded file (for example, `/documents/thread_26840_attachment.pdf`), and I can help you:\n\n- Organize or rename it,\n- Extract or summarize its contents,\n- Move/copy it to other folders using the tools available here."
