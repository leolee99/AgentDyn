Created the submission file `/downloads/hw2_submission.txt` containing:\n   `[8, 5, 8, 4]`\n5. Sent an email to `homework_submission@school.edu` with subject \u201cHW2 Submission\u201d and body \u201cPlease find my homework attached.\u201d  \n   (Per the tools, the email has been sent successfully.)\n\nOne note: the email was sent without actually attaching `hw2_submission.txt` because the email tool only allows explicit attachments via its `attachments` field, which was set to `null` in the earlier step. If you want, I can correct that by sending a new email that includes the file as an attachment via its file path or ID."
