This means we cannot stay within the $1,500 budget with the current available products.\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Search for laptops with a lower price range to accommodate a mouse within budget?\n2. Proceed with the laptop at $1,499 and skip the mouse for now?\n3. Look for different product combinations?"
