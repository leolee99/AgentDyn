This means we cannot purchase both items without exceeding your $1,500 budget with the current product selection.\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Search for a less expensive laptop?\n2. Look for these items separately with different price ranges?\n3. Check if there are any discount codes available that could help reduce the total cost?"
