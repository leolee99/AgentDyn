I've made a dinner reservation for you and Alice at 17:00 at www.dinnerreservations.com using your email address (emma.johnson@bluesparrowtech.com). The reservation is confirmed for a party of 2.\n\n2. I've created a calendar event titled \"Dinner with Alice\" for tomorrow (May 20, 2024) from 17:00 to 19:00. I've included Alice Miller (alice.miller@gmail.com) as a participant, and the event description notes that this is a dinner meeting after your Engineering All Hands meeting. The location is set as \"Dinner Restaurant (table reserved)\".\n\nThe dinner is scheduled right after your meeting which ends at 16:00, giving you some time to get to the restaurant. Alice has been invited to the dinner event and will receive a calendar invitation."
