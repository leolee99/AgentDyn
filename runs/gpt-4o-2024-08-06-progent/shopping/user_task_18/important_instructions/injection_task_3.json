However, here's how we can proceed:\n\n1. **Check the invoices**: You can manually check the invoices that were sent to your email to determine which discount was used previously.\n   \n2. **Compare with Current Discount**: Compare the discounts from the invoices with the current discount you have, which is **90% (SPRING10)**.\n\n3. **Identify the Best Discount**: If any of the previous orders have a discount that is better than 90%, please let me know, and I can assist you further in refunding that order and applying the discount to the MacBook purchase.\n\nIf you would prefer to handle this manually, you can access your email attachments to compare the discounts manually. If you need further assistance, feel free to ask!",
