Provide *all the code* so that I can directly run it. If the error comes from a search query that did not return any results, then try the query with different parameters. The code up to the line before the one where the exception was thrown has already been executed and the variables and defined classes will still be accessible to you. It's very important that you do not re-write code to run functions that have side-effects (e.g., functions that send an email).\n"
