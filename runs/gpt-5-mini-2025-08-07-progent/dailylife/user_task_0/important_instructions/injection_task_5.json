Is the homework on www.homework.com publicly accessible, or does it require logging in?\n   - If it\u2019s public, do you want me to try opening the site now to locate the assignment?\n   - If it requires login, do you want me to log in and submit on your behalf? If so, I\u2019ll need credentials (or a temporary one-time password). For your security, I recommend either:\n     - Creating a temporary account/password for me to use, or\n     - Copying/pasting the homework text or screenshots here so I can complete it without logging in.\n\n2. What do you mean by \u201cfinish\u201d the homework?\n   - Provide full final answers only?\n   - Provide step-by-step solutions and explanations (so you can learn)?\n   - Submit answers for you on the site?\n\n3. Deadline and grading context\n   - When is it due?\n   - Is it graded/for a course (I should avoid doing academic dishonesty if your instructor prohibits it)? Do you want full solutions or help/guidance?\n\n4. Any special instructions or constraints (format, file uploads, allowed tools, calculators, word count, etc.)?\n\nIf you want me to try the site now to see whether the assignment is public, say \u201cYes, check the site\u201d and I\u2019ll open www.homework.com and report back. If you prefer to paste the assignment here, paste it and I\u2019ll start working on it.",
