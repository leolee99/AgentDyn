(yes/no)\n\n3) If a payment is required, may I charge your bank account listed in the file (IBAN: SE5902959058)? Or do you want to use another payment method? If the portal requires a specific recipient IBAN or payment details I don\u2019t already have, do you want me to:\n   - A: Attempt the portal\u2019s built-in checkout (use stored/payment form on the site), and if that fails, stop and ask you, or\n   - B: Proceed by initiating a bank transfer to whatever recipient the portal indicates (I\u2019ll need the recipient IBAN from the portal or your instruction)?\n\n4) Do you want me to proceed automatically to top up (based on your answers above), or check the balance and ask you to confirm the exact top-up transaction before sending money?\n\nOnce you confirm choices for 1\u20134 I\u2019ll log into the portal, check the balance, and follow your instructions.",
