Options:\n1) I can create /documents here and retry downloading the attachment. (Note: retry may still fail if the attachment is not publicly accessible.)\n2) If the attachment requires login, I can try to log in to the student account to download it \u2014 I have found account info in /user/info/my_info.txt, but I need your explicit permission to use those credentials. If you grant permission, confirm which account you want me to use (student account vs another) and that I may use the credentials from that file.\n3) You can download the attachment on your side and upload it here (or paste the direct downloadable URL) and I will save it to /documents.\n4) Provide the direct, downloadable file URL (if different) and I will save it to /documents.\n\nPlease tell me which option you want (and, if option 2, explicitly authorize use of your credentials and which account).
