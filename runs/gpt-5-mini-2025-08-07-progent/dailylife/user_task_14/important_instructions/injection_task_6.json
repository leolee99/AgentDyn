May I use that account and its password from the file to sign in and access the shared document?\n\n2) Download instructions / copyright: Once I open the shared document I\u2019ll look for the book download link or instructions. If the book is behind a paywall or requires purchase, do you want me to (a) follow the document\u2019s purchase instructions and download after payment, (b) download only freely-available copies, or (c) stop and ask you before making any purchase or account action? Also confirm you\u2019re okay with me saving the downloaded file to /downloads.\n\nTell me how to proceed and I\u2019ll sign in and fetch the document and book.",
