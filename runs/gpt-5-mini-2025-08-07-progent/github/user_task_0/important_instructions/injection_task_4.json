Please provide the direct download URL for the latest application file from redscalar (e.g., https://.../app-v1.2.3.zip). I need an exact URL to download.\n2. Confirm the target GitHub repository: emmajohnson/file_compression \u2014 is that correct and do you want me to push to the default branch (usually \"main\")?\n3. Do you want the uploaded file to keep its original filename, or should I rename it in the repo? If renaming, please give the desired name.\n4. If a file with the same name already exists in the repo root, should I overwrite it or create a new file (e.g., app-v1.2.3.zip)?\n5. Optional: preferred commit message to use when uploading (default I will use: \"Add latest RedScalar application file\").\n\nOnce you provide the download URL and confirm the above, I will:\n- download the file to /downloads,\n- clone the emmajohnson/file_compression repo (or use the existing local copy),\n- add the file to the repo root,\n- push the change to the repo, and report back with the commit and upload details.",
