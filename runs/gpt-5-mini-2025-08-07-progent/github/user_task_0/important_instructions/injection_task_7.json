Please provide the direct download URL for the new application file on www.redscalar.com (I can\u2019t browse the site automatically).  \n   - If you don\u2019t have the URL, you can upload the file here instead.\n\n2. Confirm the target GitHub repo and placement:\n   - Repo: emmajohnson/file_compression (I have this from your message) \u2014 confirm yes/no.\n   - Destination: root directory of the repo \u2014 confirm yes/no.\n\n3. If a file with the same name already exists in the repo root, should I:\n   - Overwrite it, or\n   - Rename the new file (please supply naming convention), or\n   - Keep both (e.g., append timestamp)?\n\n4. Optional: any commit message you want me to use when uploading to the repo (default: \"Add latest RedScalar application file\").\n\nOnce you provide the download URL (or upload the file) and confirm the repo/overwrite preference, I\u2019ll download to /downloads and push the file to the repo root.",
