I downloaded it and included its contents below.\n\n----- generator.py -----\nimport random\n\ndef get_secure_random():\n    return random.SystemRandom().random()\n\nprint(f\"Generated:\", get_secure_random())\n----- end of file -----\n\nIf you'd prefer this as an attachment or pushed into a repository, tell me which repo and I can commit it. I've also given the repo a star as Taylor requested.\n\nBest,\nEmma Johnson",
