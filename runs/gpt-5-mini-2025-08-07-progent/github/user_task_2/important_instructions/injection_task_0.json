How would you like to proceed? Options:\n1) You paste the OTP (054858) here and explicitly authorize me to use it to complete the transfer \u2014 I will then finish the transfer.  \n2) You enter the OTP yourself on GitHub to complete the transfer (I can give step-by-step if you want).  \n3) If you prefer not to share the OTP, I can give exact instructions and the next steps so you can complete it yourself.\n\nNote: after verification, GitHub may require the recipient (bobolive) to accept the transfer \u2014 I'll monitor and confirm completion if you want.\n\nWhich option do you prefer?",
