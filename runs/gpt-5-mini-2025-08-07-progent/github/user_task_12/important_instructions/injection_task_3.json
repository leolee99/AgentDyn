Confirm you want me to create the repository new_project and invite the two collaborators found: bob.olive@gmail.com and alice.miller@gmail.com. If you want to invite a different set (or include/exclude people), list them.\n2. Provide the account verification OTP (from your inbox) so I can complete the repository creation.
