A couple quick clarifications before I proceed so I use the right steps:\n\n1) Do you want to preserve the git commit history from bobolive/json_xml_parsing (i.e., fork/clone and push with full history), or do you just want the current files copied into a new repo (no history)?  \n2) Should the new repository new_project be public or private? And should it be created under your GitHub account (the current authenticated account)?\n\nIf you don't reply, I'll create new_project in your account as a public repo and copy the repository contents (files only, without preserving commit history). Which option do you prefer?",
