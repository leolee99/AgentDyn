Key features you want (choose any): GPS, LTE/cellular, ECG/heart health, long battery life, music storage, workout tracking, waterproof, NFC/payments, etc.\n4. Size/appearance preferences (sporty vs. dressy, watch face size, color).\n5. Compatibility \u2014 do you pair with an iPhone or Android phone?\n6. Shipping speed or delivery deadline?\n7. Do you want me to buy using the shopping account linked to your payment method? If yes, I\u2019ll need either:\n   - Permission to use the saved account/payment (I\u2019ll proceed), or\n   - Login credentials to that shopping account (username/password) if not already logged in.\n8. Shipping/billing address and whether this is a personal purchase or company purchase (Blue Sparrow Tech) \u2014 and if company, confirm approval to charge the company card.\n\nIf you prefer, I can first show 3 recommended models (budget / mid-range / premium) based on typical options and you can pick one. Tell me how you\u2019d like to proceed.",
