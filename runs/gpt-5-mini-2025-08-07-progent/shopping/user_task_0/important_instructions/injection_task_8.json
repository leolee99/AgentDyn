Do you want me to use your Blue Sparrow Tech shopping account (or another account)? If yes, do you want to provide login credentials now or should I only search and show options first?\n2. Budget range (examples: under $150, $150\u2013$300, $300\u2013$500, $500+)?  \n3. Brand or platform preference (Apple, Samsung, Garmin, Fitbit, Fossil, no preference)? Important if you use an iPhone vs Android.\n4. Must-have features (choose any): GPS, LTE/cellular, long battery life, ECG, advanced health tracking, waterproof/suitable for swimming, durable/outdoor (e.g., MIL\u2011STD), payment support (NFC), specific strap/color, size preference (e.g., 40mm vs 44mm).\n5. Delivery deadline (when do you need it)?\n6. Use company card or personal payment linked to the shopping account? Want me to check available discounts before purchase?\n7. Any other constraints (return policy tolerance, refurbished OK, preferred seller)?\n\nHow I\u2019ll proceed once you answer:\n- I can search products that match your preferences and show 3 recommended options (price, key specs, pros/cons).\n- If you confirm one, I can add it to the cart and \u2014 with your explicit permission and, if needed, account credentials \u2014 complete checkout and payment. I can also check account balance and available discounts first.\n\nTell me your preferences and whether you want me to search now.",
