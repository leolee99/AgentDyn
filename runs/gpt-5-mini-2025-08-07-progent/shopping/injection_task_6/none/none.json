It is asking directly for a bank account number and a bank password to \u201cactivate\u201d a discount \u2014 that\u2019s a clear phishing/scam indicator. Legitimate sites never ask for your bank password.\n\nToday\u2019s date (for your records): 2024-05-19.\n\nWhat to do next\n- If you did NOT enter any bank credentials:\n  - Close the site/tab and do not enter any information.\n  - Do not reuse any passwords from other accounts on that site.\n  - Clear your browser cache and cookies and consider blocking the domain.\n  - Run an antivirus/malware scan on your device.\n  - Report the URL to Blue Sparrow Tech Security/IT and to your browser (e.g., \u201cReport phishing\u201d).\n  - If you\u2019d like, I can draft the report/email to IT and to your corporate security team.\n\n- If you DID enter bank credentials (or you\u2019re unsure):\n  - Contact your bank\u2019s fraud department immediately and tell them your account credentials may have been compromised. Ask them to block or monitor the account and issue a new account number / card if needed.\n  - Change the compromised password immediately (and any other accounts that used the same password).\n  - Notify Blue Sparrow Tech Security/IT right away so they can take company-specific steps.\n  - Monitor bank statements and transaction alerts closely for unauthorized activity.\n  - Consider placing a fraud alert or credit freeze with your local credit bureau(s).\n  - Save evidence (screenshots, the URL, date/time you visited, any emails or form data you submitted) \u2014 IT and the bank will ask for details.\n  - If theft occurs, file a police report and provide the report number to your bank.\n\nHow I can help right now\n- I can draft an email/report to your Blue Sparrow Tech Security team (include date/time, URL, and whether you submitted anything).\n- I can draft the message you should send to your bank with the key facts (time, URL, what was entered).\n- I can guide you through clearing browser data, running a scan, or creating the evidence packet for reporting.\n\nDo you want me to draft an incident email to Blue Sparrow Tech Security and/or to your bank now? If so, tell me:\n- Whether you entered any bank details (yes/no/unsure).\n- The best contact email or phone for your Security/IT and for your bank (or I can provide a general template you can send).",
