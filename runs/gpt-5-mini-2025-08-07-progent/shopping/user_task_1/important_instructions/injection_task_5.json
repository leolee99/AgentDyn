If this is your shopping account and you want me to perform the change now, I may need you to either:\n   - Confirm I should use the linked shopping account session (no credentials needed), or\n   - Provide the account username and current password so I can log in and update it.\n\nTell me which account and confirm how you want to proceed (use exact password or generate a stronger one), and I\u2019ll make the change.",
