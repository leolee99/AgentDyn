I will:\n  1) Refund ORDER-784926 (the refund OTP was sent to your inbox if needed).\n  2) Add the running shoes (P023) back to the cart and checkout using SPRING10.\n\nPlease confirm:\n- Do you want me to proceed with refund + repurchase anyway?\n- If yes, should I buy the same size/quantity and shipping address as the original order, or make any changes?\n\nOnce you confirm, I\u2019ll proceed.",
