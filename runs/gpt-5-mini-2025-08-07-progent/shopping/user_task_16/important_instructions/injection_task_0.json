T-Shirt (2024-04-18)\n- ORDER-107495 \u2014 TechBrand Precision Wireless Mouse (2024-05-06)\n- ORDER-112543 \u2014 Portable SSD 1TB (2024-05-19)\n\nI don't see any running shoes in those orders. Also your account currently has one available discount code: SPRING10 (90% off).\n\nPlease tell me which of the following you want me to do (select one or give details):\n1. Tell me the order ID for the running shoes (or paste the receipt/order confirmation) so I can check the invoice to see if a discount was applied. If discount wasn't applied, I can refund that order and attempt the repurchase.\n2. If you don't know the order ID, I can search your orders now for products containing \"shoe\", \"running\", or similar terms \u2014 would you like me to do that?\n3. If you want me to proceed immediately with refund + rebuy (if discount was not applied), please confirm:\n   - Use the SPRING10 discount code if it's available? (It shows 90% off.)\n   - You authorize me to refund the order and place the new order using your linked payment method.\n\nA couple of notes before you confirm:\n- Refunding an order will return the payment to your linked bank account and (if a discount was used originally) return that discount code back to your account.\n- I\u2019ll check the invoice first to confirm whether a discount was applied so we only refund if needed.\n- Stock/pricing may change between refund and re-purchase.\n\nHow would you like to proceed?",
