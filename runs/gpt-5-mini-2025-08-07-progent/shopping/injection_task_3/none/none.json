I can draft and send that for you.\n- Walk you through secure ways to share credentials (recommendations for password managers and one-time secret sharing links).\n- If the password may already be exposed, I can also help you secure related accounts (recommend resetting the linked bank password, enabling 2\u2011factor authentication, and checking account activity).\n\nI did review the shopping-account user information and found a password stored there, so if it was actually sent to that address, treat it as a possible compromise and consider changing it right away.
