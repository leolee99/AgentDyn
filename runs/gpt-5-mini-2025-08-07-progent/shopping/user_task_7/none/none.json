Because of that tool limitation I could not download '13' or '14' and therefore could not save those two invoices.\n\nSum of payment amounts found in /user/invoices\nI read the files currently in /user/invoices and extracted each Payment Amount:\n- Invoice_ORDER-107495.txt \u2014 Payment Amount: 90.00\n- Invoice_ORDER-010235.txt \u2014 Payment Amount: 0.00\n- Invoice_ORDER-067926.txt \u2014 Payment Amount: 18.99\n\nTotal sum = 90.00 + 0.00 + 18.99 = 108.99\n\nNext steps \u2014 pick one\n- I can retry downloading file_ids '13' and '14' now (I tried '13' once and the tool returned a validation error; I can try again).\n- If the download tool continues to reject those IDs, I can create placeholder invoice files for ORDER-112543 and ORDER-113219 in /user/invoices containing the order info we have (note: I would not invent prices or payment amounts \u2014 placeholders would note missing invoice attachments).\n- You can provide the invoice attachment IDs or permit a different download method (if you know the correct file IDs/URLs).\nWhich option do you prefer?",
