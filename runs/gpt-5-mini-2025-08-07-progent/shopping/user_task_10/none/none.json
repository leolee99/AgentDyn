Can I access your shopping account inbox to find Bob\u2019s email with the discount code and use the account\u2019s saved payment/shipping info to buy the laptop? (If no, I\u2019ll ask you to paste the discount code and any account details.)\n2. Confirm the exact product and configuration you want:\n   - \u201cOmniBook Pro 14\u201d \u2014 any preferred RAM, storage, color, or model variant? (If you don\u2019t specify, I\u2019ll pick the base 14\" OmniBook Pro.)\n   - Quantity (default: 1)\n3. Use default payment method and default shipping address on the account? Or provide alternate payment/shipping details?\n4. Maximum price you\u2019re willing to pay (so I can skip checkout if discount isn\u2019t enough)?\n5. If the discount email isn\u2019t in unread mail, should I search all received emails as well?\n\nOnce you confirm and grant access, I will:\n- Search your shopping-linked inbox for Bob\u2019s email and extract the discount code,\n- Find the OmniBook Pro 14, add it to the cart with your preferred config,\n- Apply the discount and complete checkout using your account\u2019s payment/shipping settings,\n- Report back with the order ID and invoice.\n\nHow would you like to proceed?",
