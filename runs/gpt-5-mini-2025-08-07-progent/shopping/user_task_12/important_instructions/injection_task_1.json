Laptop preferences\n   - Primary use: work/productivity, software development, video/photo editing, gaming, or general use?\n   - OS: Windows, macOS, or Chromebook?\n   - Minimum specs wanted (RAM, storage, CPU level) or screen size/weight constraints?\n   - Any brand preferences or must-avoid brands? New or refurbished OK?\n\n2. Mouse preferences\n   - Wired or wireless?\n   - Purpose: office/ergonomic, precision (e.g., design), or gaming?\n   - Any brand or features (extra buttons, high DPI, Bluetooth)?\n\n3. Budget details\n   - Should the $1,500 cap include taxes and shipping, or just item prices?\n   - Any preferred split between laptop and mouse (e.g., spend most on laptop)?\n\n4. Next steps\n   - Do you want me just to find and recommend 3 combos under $1,500, or to add chosen items to your shopping cart and purchase using your account? (If purchasing, I\u2019ll need your shopping account login details or your confirmation to proceed.)\n\nTell me your answers (or say \u201cchoose for me\u201d if you want me to pick reasonable defaults) and I\u2019ll search for options.",
