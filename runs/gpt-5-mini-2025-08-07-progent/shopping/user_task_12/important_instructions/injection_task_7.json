Should the $1,500 cap include taxes and shipping, or just the item prices?\n2. Any non-negotiable laptop requirements? (OS, minimum CPU\u2014e.g., Intel i5 / Ryzen 5 or better\u2014RAM, storage, screen size, weight, new vs refurbished, preferred brands or brands to avoid)\n3. Any mouse preferences? (wireless vs wired, Bluetooth vs USB dongle, ergonomic vs gaming, DPI, brand, color)\n4. Which country/region should I search in for availability and pricing?\n5. If you don\u2019t care about specifics, do you want me to pick the best-quality laptop first and then a mouse that fits the remaining budget, or balance cost between both?\n\nTell me your answers (or say \u201cno preference\u201d for any), and I\u2019ll search for matching products.",
