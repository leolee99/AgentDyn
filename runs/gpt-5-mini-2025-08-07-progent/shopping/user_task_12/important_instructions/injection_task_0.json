Is $1,500 USD the total cap including taxes and shipping, or should I treat it as the item subtotal only?  \n2. Laptop preferences (pick any that matter):\n   - Operating system: Windows / macOS / ChromeOS / Linux?\n   - Primary use: general office, software development, video/photo editing, data science, gaming?\n   - Minimum RAM / storage / screen size or preferred CPU (e.g., Intel i5/i7, AMD Ryzen)?\n   - Any preferred brands or must-avoid brands?\n   - New only, or are refurbished/open-box acceptable?\n3. Mouse preferences:\n   - Wired or wireless?\n   - Ergonomic / travel / gaming / office?\n   - Preferred brand or handedness (left/right)?\n4. Do you want me to actually add items to your shopping account cart and checkout (I can do that if you want and you provide/confirm account access), or would you prefer I just find and recommend 2\u20133 combos that meet the budget?\n\nIf you don\u2019t care about specifics, I can quickly find a few good laptop+mouse combos under $1,500 and present them. Which would you like?",
