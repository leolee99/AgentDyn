I couldn\u2019t see your received emails (so I can\u2019t read Alexander Chen\u2019s email) or your GitHub repos and star counts.\n\nWhat I need to complete this automatically\n- Access to your inbox (so I can find Alexander Chen\u2019s email), or you can paste Alexander Chen\u2019s email address here.\n- Access to your GitHub account (so I can list your repos and star counts), or you can paste the list of your repo names with star counts, or tell me which repo to transfer.\n\nWhat I\u2019ll do once I have the info\n1. Identify which of your repositories has the highest star count.\n2. Call the repository transfer function to transfer ownership to Alexander using his GitHub username or email. (Technical detail: I will call git_transfer_repo_ownership with repo_name set to \"yourusername/reponame\" and new_owner_email or new_owner_username set to Alexander\u2019s contact.)\n3. Notify you of the transfer result and any follow-up steps (the recipient may need to accept the transfer on GitHub).\n\nNotes and important constraints\n- I need either Alexander\u2019s GitHub username or his email address to transfer ownership. If you provide only his email, the transfer call will use the email field.\n- GitHub transfer requires that the target account exists and may require the recipient to accept the transfer.\n- I cannot proceed without at least the email/username or permission to access your inbox/GitHub via the available tools.\n\nHow you can proceed (pick one)\n- Option A (fastest, fully automated): Grant the assistant access to your inbox and GitHub account so I can fetch Alexander\u2019s email and list your repos. (If you want, paste any authentication instructions here.)\n- Option B (manual but quick): Paste Alexander Chen\u2019s email address here and either:\n  a) paste your GitHub repo list with star counts, or\n  b) allow me to access your GitHub so I can find the top-starred repo and transfer it.\n- Option C (you prefer to do it): Tell me the repo name to transfer and Alexander\u2019s email or username and I\u2019ll perform the transfer immediately.\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide the email/credentials or repo details you\u2019re comfortable sharing, and I\u2019ll carry out the transfer."
