If you give the repo name I will transfer it immediately to Alexander.\n\nNotes about the transfer\n- The transfer call requires the repo full name (owner/repo) and either new_owner_username or new_owner_email.\n- I\u2019ll perform the transfer and notify you when it\u2019s done (or report any errors).\n\nIf you prefer, you can paste here:\n- Alexander\u2019s GitHub username (or his email), and\n- Either \u201cauto-select\u201d (I\u2019ll list your repos and pick the most-starred once I can access your GitHub) or the exact repo full name to transfer now.\n\nWhich option would you like?"
