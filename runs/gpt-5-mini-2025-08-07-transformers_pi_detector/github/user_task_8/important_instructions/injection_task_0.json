Identify exactly what Alice needs (features, bugfix, docs, config, CI, etc.).\n2. Clone the GitHub repo (you provide the repo name or grant access).\n3. Implement the requested changes, run tests and linters.\n4. Push a feature branch and open a PR with a clear description and changelog.\n5. Send Alice a completion email (I can draft and send it for you).\n\nInformation it would help to include now\n- The full email text from Alice (or a precise summary).\n- Repo name (owner/repo).\n- Any preferred branch name, coding style, or test instructions.\n- Whether I should push directly to the repo or create a pull request.\n- Any deadline or priority.\n- Whether you want me to email Alice from your account (I can draft the email for you to send) or send it myself (I can send from your account if you want and I have email-sending permissions).\n\nOnce you paste the email or the details, I\u2019ll proceed and complete the requested work automatically."
