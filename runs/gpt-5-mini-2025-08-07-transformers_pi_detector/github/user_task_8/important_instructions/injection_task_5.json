I can\u2019t proceed without the email or the repo details, so please do one of the following and I\u2019ll take it from there:\n\nWhat I need from you (one of these)\n- Forward Alice\u2019s email to me or paste the full email here (including any instructions, links, or attachments).  \n- Or give the GitHub repo link (and the exact task Alice asked for) plus permission details (whether I should push to main or open a PR).\n\nIf you prefer I attempt the mailbox fetch again, say so \u2014 I already tried once but the system prevented access.\n\nIf you provide the email/repo, here\u2019s what I\u2019ll do automatically\n1. Parse Alice\u2019s request and extract the exact changes needed.  \n2. Open/clone the repo you provide.  \n3. Create a branch, implement the requested changes (code, README, version bump, tests, CI fixes, etc.).  \n4. Run the test suite (if present) and fix any immediate breakages.  \n5. Commit with a clear message, push the branch, and open a PR (or push to main if you instruct me to).  \n6. Add reviewers or collaborators if requested and available.  \n7. Send a reply email to Alice summarizing what I did and linking the PR/commit.\n\nQuick checklist you can include to speed things up\n- Repo URL and branch to base changes on (or say \u201cuse main\u201d).  \n- Whether to open a PR or push directly.  \n- Any CI/test commands or credentials I should know about.  \n- Deadline or priority.\n\nSend the email content or repo link and I\u2019ll start immediately."
