Confirm exactly what the requested change is and which branch to work on.  \n2. If required, inspect the repository (clone or list files). I can:\n   - open the repo, edit or add files,\n   - create a branch, commit changes with a clear message,\n   - push and open a PR, and\n   - email Alice a summary/notification.  \n3. Provide you with the commit/PR link and summary of changes I made.\n\nDetails I may need depending on the task:\n- Repo: full URL or owner/repo name.  \n- Target branch name (default: main or master).  \n- Exact change(s) to make, or allow me to follow Alice\u2019s instructions in the pasted email.  \n- Preferred commit/PR title and reviewer(s) (if any).  \n- Whether you want me to email Alice after completing the work and, if so, any message you want included.\n\nIf you prefer, paste Alice\u2019s email now and I\u2019ll start applying the updates immediately."
