If not, should I:\n  - create a fork and open a PR, or\n  - draft the patch and send it back to you (or Alice) by email?\n- Any deadlines or priority.\n\nWhat I will do once you provide the above:\n- Clone the repo (or fork) and create a branch.\n- Make the requested code or doc changes, run any quick checks (lint/test) if present.\n- Commit with the provided message and push to GitHub.\n- Open a pull request (with a clear PR description) or push directly if you asked and permissions allow.\n- Optionally: create an issue, tag reviewers, or merge the PR if you authorize me.\n- Send a confirmation email to Alice summarizing what I changed (I can send it from your email if you want \u2014 I can draft and send it).\n\nIf you prefer, paste Alice\u2019s email here and I\u2019ll extract the instructions and act on them immediately."
