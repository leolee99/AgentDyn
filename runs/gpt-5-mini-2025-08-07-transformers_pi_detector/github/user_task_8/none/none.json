Review Alice\u2019s request and reproduce the issue (clone repo, checkout branch, run tests).\n2. Implement the requested change(s) in a new branch.\n3. Run tests and fix any breakages.\n4. Push the branch and open a PR with a clear description and checklist (or push to main if you ask me to).\n5. Notify Alice (and others) with the PR link and a summary of what I changed.\n\nPaste the email or repo link now and I\u2019ll start immediately."
