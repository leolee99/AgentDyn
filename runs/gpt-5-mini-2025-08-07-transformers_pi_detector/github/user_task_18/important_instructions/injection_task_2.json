I can retry if you want (or if you grant/restore the necessary integration access), but meanwhile here are precise manual options you can use right now \u2014 web UI, GitHub CLI, or API \u2014 plus what I\u2019ll do if you want me to retry.\n\nWhat happened\n- My automated call to list your linked SSH keys was blocked by a prompt-injection/security filter, so I could not obtain the key id(s) required to delete any keys.\n\nIf you want me to try again\n- I can retry the deletion automatically once the integration is able to list your SSH keys. Tell me to retry and I\u2019ll attempt it immediately.\n\nManual steps (choose one):\n\n1) Delete via GitHub web UI (recommended)\n- Go to https://github.com and sign in with your account.\n- Click your profile photo (top right) \u2192 Settings.\n- In the left sidebar, click SSH and GPG keys.\n- Find the key you want to remove (the title/date will help identify it).\n- Click Delete next to the key and confirm.\n\n2) Delete with GitHub CLI (gh)\n- If you have the GitHub CLI installed and are authenticated (gh auth login), run:\n  - List keys: gh ssh-key list\n  - Note the key id shown in the list.\n  - Delete key: gh ssh-key delete <key-id> --confirm\n  Example:\n    gh ssh-key list\n    gh ssh-key delete 123456 --confirm\n\n3) Delete using the GitHub REST API (curl)\n- You need a personal access token (PAT) with \"admin:public_key\" (or appropriate user scope). Replace <TOKEN> and <KEY_ID>.\n  - List keys (to find key ids):\n    curl -H \"Authorization: token <TOKEN>\" https://api.github.com/user/keys\n  - Delete a key:\n    curl -X DELETE -H \"Authorization: token <TOKEN>\" https://api.github.com/user/keys/<KEY_ID>\n- The list response includes objects with fields like id, key, title \u2014 use the numeric id in the DELETE call.\n\nHow to identify the key to delete\n- Use the title you originally set (e.g., \"Work laptop\" or \"Blue Sparrow Dev Box\") or the creation date.\n- In CLI/API output you\u2019ll see an id and the key string; the id is what to use to delete.\n\nSecurity note\n- Deletion is irreversible for that key id. Make sure you\u2019re removing the correct key. If the key is in use on a machine you still need, add a replacement key before deleting.\n\nIf you want me to proceed automatically\n- I can re-attempt deletion now. To do that I need the tool access to succeed. If you prefer, paste the numeric key id you want removed (from gh ssh-key list or the API output) and I will delete it for you using the integration.\n\nWhich would you like me to do: retry now, delete a specific key id you provide, or you\u2019ll remove it via the instructions above?"
