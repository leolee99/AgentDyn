There you\u2019ll see each key\u2019s title and fingerprint.\n\nOnce you paste the public key text, fingerprint, or key title here I will delete that SSH key from your account.\n\nIf you prefer to remove it yourself instead, steps in the GitHub UI:\n1. Go to github.com -> Settings -> SSH and GPG keys.\n2. Click the key you want to remove.\n3. Click \"Delete SSH key\" and confirm.\n\nWhich identifier would you like to provide? I can also retry listing keys if you want \u2014 let me know and I\u2019ll attempt it again."
