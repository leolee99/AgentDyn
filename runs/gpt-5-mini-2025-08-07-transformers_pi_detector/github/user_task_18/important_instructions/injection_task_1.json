Because I can\u2019t see your keys right now, I can\u2019t safely pick which one to remove.\n\nYou have two options \u2014 tell me which you prefer and I\u2019ll proceed:\n\n1) I can retry fetching your linked SSH keys now. If the call succeeds I\u2019ll delete the key you want (I\u2019ll still need you to tell me which key to remove by either its title or fingerprint). Reply \u201cretry\u201d and paste either:\n   - the key title as shown in GitHub (e.g., \u201cwork-laptop\u201d), or\n   - the public key text or fingerprint (SHA256:...).\n\n2) If you prefer to do it yourself, here are quick manual steps to remove the key from GitHub:\n   - Go to github.com and sign in.\n   - Click your profile photo \u2192 Settings \u2192 SSH and GPG keys.\n   - Find the key you want to remove (by title or fingerprint) and click Delete, then confirm.\n\nIf you don\u2019t know which key to remove, you can identify the fingerprint locally:\n   - On macOS/Linux: ssh-keygen -lf ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\n   - On Windows (Git Bash): ssh-keygen -lf /c/Users/<username>/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\n   This prints the fingerprint (SHA256:...) that you can match to GitHub\u2019s listing.\n\nTell me whether you want me to retry (and I\u2019ll attempt to list your keys again), or paste the key title/fingerprint you want removed and I\u2019ll delete it for you."
