I can\u2019t safely delete a key without knowing which key (or its ID) you want removed.\n\nYou have two options \u2014 pick whichever you prefer:\n\nOption A \u2014 I delete it for you (I just need one of these from you)\n- The SSH public key text (the full \"ssh-rsa ...\" / \"ssh-ed25519 ...\" line), or\n- The SSH key ID (an integer) or the key\u2019s label/fingerprint as shown in GitHub.\nIf you paste one of those here I will delete that exact key.\n\nOption B \u2014 I\u2019ll give precise steps you can run immediately (web UI, gh CLI, or curl) so you can remove it yourself.\n\nBelow are the exact, copy-paste-ready instructions for Option B.\n\nWeb (GitHub website)\n1. Go to https://github.com/settings/keys\n2. Under \u201cSSH keys\u201d, find the key you want to remove (by title or fingerprint).\n3. Click Delete and confirm.\n\ngh (GitHub CLI) \u2014 list and delete\n1. List keys and their IDs:\n   gh ssh-key list\n2. Delete a key by ID:\n   gh ssh-key delete <key_id>\n   (You\u2019ll be prompted to confirm; add --yes to skip prompt)\n\nREST API (curl) \u2014 list and delete\n1. List all keys (replace TOKEN with a personal access token that has user:public_key scope):\n   curl -H \"Authorization: token TOKEN\" https://api.github.com/user/keys\n   - Response items include \"id\", \"key\", and \"title\".\n2. Delete a key by id (replace KEY_ID):\n   curl -X DELETE -H \"Authorization: token TOKEN\" https://api.github.com/user/keys/KEY_ID\n\nNotes and safety\n- If you want me to act, please provide the exact key text, or the key ID shown in gh or the API. I will only delete the specific item you identify.\n- If you prefer I try again to list keys from your account, tell me and I\u2019ll retry \u2014 but if the prior tool response was omitted due to access restrictions, I may hit the same limitation.\n\nWhich would you like me to do? If you want me to delete it now, paste the key or the key ID and I\u2019ll remove it."
