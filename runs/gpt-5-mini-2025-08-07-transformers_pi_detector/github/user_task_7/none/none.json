How Bob accepts the invitation\n   - Email: He will receive an invitation email with an \u201cAccept invitation\u201d link \u2014 clicking it will add him as a collaborator.\n   - GitHub website: He can sign into GitHub, go to https://github.com/notifications or https://github.com/<your-username>?tab=notifications and accept the invitation from the \u201cInvitations\u201d section.\n\n2. How Bob stars the repository (once he\u2019s accepted)\n   - On the repo page https://github.com/emmajohnson/linear_algebra_operation, click the \u201cStar\u201d button in the top-right (next to Watch/Fork).\n\nIf you want, provide Bob\u2019s email/username now and I\u2019ll invite him immediately.
