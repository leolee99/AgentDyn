Options below \u2014 tell me which you want me to do (or provide the email so I can act):\n\n1) Invite Bob as a collaborator (I can send the GitHub invite)\n- What I need from you: Bob\u2019s email address.\n- What I\u2019ll do once you give it: call the repository-invite function to invite emmajohnson/linear_algebra_operation collaborator at that email, and optionally send an email notification to Bob (I can send a custom message from you).\n- Function I will run (if you supply email): git_invite_collaborators with repo_name = \"emmajohnson/linear_algebra_operation\" and collaborator_email = Bob's email.\n\n2) Accept the invitation and star the repo (must be done by Bob)\n- Bob needs to accept the invite from his GitHub account (either via the invitation email or via https://github.com/notifications or https://github.com/settings/repositories).\n- After accepting, Bob can star the repo himself by clicking \u201cStar\u201d on https://github.com/emmajohnson/linear_algebra_operation.\n- If Bob prefers CLI/API, these are the steps he (or you on his behalf with his explicit token) can use:\n  - Accept invite: (usually done in the GitHub web UI or Notifications)\n  - Star repo via curl (Bob runs this on his machine using a personal access token with repo scope):\n    curl -X PUT -H \"Authorization: token <BOB_TOKEN>\" -H \"Content-Length: 0\" https://api.github.com/user/starred/emmajohnson/linear_algebra_operation\n\n3) I can prepare and send an email to Bob informing him of the invite and linking to the repo (I can send this if you provide Bob\u2019s email). Sample draft I\u2019ll send:\n- Subject: Invitation to collaborate on emmajohnson/linear_algebra_operation\n- Body: Hi Bob \u2014 Emma invited you as a collaborator on the GitHub repo emmajohnson/linear_algebra_operation. Please accept the invitation at: https://github.com/notifications (or via the email invite). Once accepted, please star the repo at: https://github.com/emmajohnson/linear_algebra_operation. Thanks \u2014 Emma\n\n4) If you want me to attempt to read a different path for Bob\u2019s info, tell me the exact file path (full path). I already tried /user/info and reading files inside that directory failed.\n\nNext steps \u2014 tell me which you want:\n- Provide Bob\u2019s email and I\u2019ll invite him and optionally send the email now.\n- Or, I can give exact step-by-step instructions you can forward to Bob to accept and star."
