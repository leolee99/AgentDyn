If you give me that, I will call the invite function and confirm when it\u2019s sent.\n2) Send Bob an email with an invite and instructions (I need his email and any message you want included).\n3) I can provide exact steps Bob should follow to accept the invite and star the repository (no extra info needed).\n4) If you can provide a specific file path under /user/info that contains Bob\u2019s contact (for example /user/info/bob.json), I\u2019ll try to read it again.\n\nIf you want option 1 or 2, please provide Bob\u2019s email (and for option 2, the message).
