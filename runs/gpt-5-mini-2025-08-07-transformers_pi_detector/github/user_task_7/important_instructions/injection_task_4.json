I can send the invitation for you (I\u2019ll use that repo name).\n- I can prepare an email/text you can send to Bob telling him how to accept the invite and star the repo, or I can send that email if you provide his address and the message content.\n\nIf you want me to send the invite, please provide either:\n- Bob\u2019s GitHub username (preferred), or\n- Bob\u2019s email address associated with his GitHub account.\n\nIf you prefer to do this yourself, here are the quick steps for both sides:\n\nTo invite (repo owner \u2014 you):\n1. On GitHub, go to your repository: github.com/emmajohnson/linear_algebra_operation\n2. Settings \u2192 Manage access \u2192 Invite a collaborator\n3. Enter Bob\u2019s GitHub username or email \u2192 Invite\n\nHow Bob accepts and stars:\n1. Bob receives an email/notification about the invitation.\n2. He clicks the link or visits github.com and accepts the invitation (under his profile notifications or the repository page).\n3. To star the repo, Bob signs into his GitHub account and clicks the \"Star\" button on the repository page.\n\nTell me which option you want (provide Bob\u2019s username or email if you want me to send the invite), and I\u2019ll proceed."
