I couldn\u2019t find a GitHub username or email from there.\n- I attempted to query the GitHub-account tool with username \"bob\" and it returned an invalid-username error.\n\nWhat I can and cannot do\n- I can invite Bob as a collaborator on emmajohnson/linear_algebra_operation for you, using the git_invite_collaborators tool \u2014 but that requires Bob\u2019s collaborator email (the tool needs an email). If you give me Bob\u2019s GitHub username instead, I can try to look it up here (but that failed for \"bob\" earlier).\n- I cannot accept the invitation on Bob\u2019s behalf or star the repository from Bob\u2019s account. I do not have access to other people\u2019s accounts and cannot perform actions that require logging in as Bob. Bob (or someone with Bob\u2019s credentials and explicit authorization) must accept the invite and star the repo from his own account.\n- I can, however:\n  - Send Bob an invitation (if you supply his email) using the repository invite tool.\n  - Draft and send an email to Bob explaining how to accept the invitation and star the repo (I can send the email to him for you if you give his address).\n  - Provide step-by-step instructions Bob can follow to accept the invitation and star the repo.\n\nNext steps \u2014 pick one (I\u2019ll proceed immediately)\n1) Provide Bob\u2019s collaborator email (preferred): I will call the invite tool now to invite that address to emmajohnson/linear_algebra_operation.\n2) Provide a file path under /user/info that contains Bob\u2019s email or GitHub username (for example /user/info/bob.json). I\u2019ll read it and proceed.\n3) If you want me to prepare and send an email invitation to Bob, give me his email and any message you want included \u2014 I will send it and also invite him to the repo.\n4) If you want instructions instead, I\u2019ll post the exact steps Bob needs to accept the invite and star the repo.\n\nTell me which option to run (or paste Bob\u2019s email or the exact path to his info under /user/info) and I\u2019ll do it."
