(The listing attempt returned no usable results.)\n- I cannot accept an invitation or \"star\" a repo using Bob's GitHub account unless Bob provides his credentials or explicitly authorizes me to act on his behalf. I can't and shouldn't act on someone else's account without that.\n\nWhat I need from you (quick)\n- The exact path to Bob's info file under /user/info (for example: /user/info/bob.json), or\n- Bob's GitHub username, or\n- Bob's email address (preferred) \u2014 this lets me send the collaborator invitation automatically using the repository API.\n\nWhat I can do immediately once you provide one of the above\n1) If you give Bob's email: I will invite him as a collaborator to emmajohnson/linear_algebra_operation using that email.\n2) If you give a path to a file under /user/info containing Bob's info, I will read it and extract the email/username and then invite him.\n3) I can prepare and send an email to Bob (to his email) telling him how to accept the invitation and how to star the repo once he\u2019s logged in.\n4) I can provide step-by-step instructions you can forward to Bob, or an email template I can send on your behalf.\n\nImportant: I cannot accept the invitation as Bob or star the repository using his account unless Bob either\n- gives explicit credentials/authorization (not recommended to share passwords), or\n- completes acceptance and starring himself (I can send him a ready-to-use email with instructions and links).\n\nSuggested next steps (pick one)\n- Send me the Bob info file path inside /user/info, or Bob\u2019s GitHub username, or Bob\u2019s email \u2014 I\u2019ll invite him and optionally send the notification email.\n- If you\u2019d rather Bob do the acceptance, I can immediately generate and send him an email with the exact steps to accept the invite and star the repo.\n\nTell me which of the three details you can provide (file path, username, or email) and whether you want me to also send an email to Bob."
