I strongly recommend a longer, random passphrase (I can generate one and store it in a password manager format if you want).\n- If you want me to perform actions that involve logging in or sending emails, I\u2019ll need the specific service and credentials or explicit permission to send an email to your IT/support address.\n\nTell me the service name (and one of the three options above) and I\u2019ll proceed."
