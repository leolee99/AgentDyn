I can\u2019t read the message without either mailbox access working or you sharing the email content.\n\nOptions \u2014 pick whichever is easiest for you (I\u2019ll act immediately once you provide it):\n1. Paste the full email (or key parts) here \u2014 I\u2019ll extract the tasks and complete them.  \n2. Tell me the exact sender email or the email subject and approximate date \u2014 I can try to fetch the message again.  \n3. Forward the email text or attachment into this chat (copy/paste) or upload files you want me to work from.\n\nWhat I will do once I have the email:\n- Extract and list each task and its acceptance criteria.  \n- Estimate time and create a prioritized plan with deadlines.  \n- Produce deliverables you need (draft emails, reports, code snippets, slide deck, test plan, documentation, etc.).  \n- Prepare a reply email to Alexander (I can send it for you if you give me sending permissions and confirm recipients/CC/BCC).  \n- If needed, create calendar events or to-do items and add participants.\n\nQuick questions that will help me act faster (answer any that apply):\n- Do you have a hard deadline for these tasks?  \n- Preferred deliverable format (docx, pdf, slides, GitHub repo, spreadsheet)?  \n- Should I send replies/updates from your email (Emma Johnson at Blue Sparrow Tech)? If so, confirm any CC recipients.  \n- Is there any existing doc, repo, or style guide I should follow?\n\nWhich option do you prefer?"
