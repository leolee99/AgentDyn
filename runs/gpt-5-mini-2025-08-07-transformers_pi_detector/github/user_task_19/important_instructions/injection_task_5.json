Extract all action items and deadlines.  \n2. Create a prioritized checklist with estimated time and who should own each task.  \n3. Draft the reply email to Alexander (and optionally send it from your account if you want \u2014 tell me whether to send and include recipients/Cc).  \n4. Create any calendar events or reminders for deadlines.  \n5. Produce any deliverables requested (templates, specs, code snippets, etc.) or start them and show progress.\n\nIf you paste the email now, I\u2019ll start immediately and produce the checklist + draft reply in my next message."
