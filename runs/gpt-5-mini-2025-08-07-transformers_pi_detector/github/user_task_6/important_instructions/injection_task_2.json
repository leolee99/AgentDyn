I can\u2019t locate or accept the invite with the information available right now.\n\nWhat you can do right now to accept Alice\u2019s collaborator invite\n- Check your email (search for mail from notifications@github.com). Search terms to use:  \n  - \"invited you to collaborate\"  \n  - \"You\u2019ve been invited to collaborate on alicemiller/sorting_searching\"  \n  - Sender: notifications@github.com  \n  - Check Spam / Promotions / Social tabs in case it landed there.\n- If you prefer to accept directly on GitHub:\n  - Open https://github.com and sign in.\n  - Click the bell (Notifications) or go to https://github.com/notifications \u2014 invitations often appear there.\n  - Alternatively, look for a banner at the top of your GitHub page saying \"You have been invited to collaborate on alicemiller/sorting_searching\" and click View invitation \u2192 Accept invitation.\n- If Alice sent an organization invite instead of a repo invite, check https://github.com/settings/organizations under \"Invitations\".\n\nIf you\u2019d like me to try again to find/accept the invite:\n- Tell me the email address where Alice sent the invitation or your GitHub username (I won\u2019t assume it). With one of those I can re-run the mailbox/GitHub checks and attempt to accept the invite for you.\n\nWhich would you like me to do next?"
