(If PR, name reviewers and target branch.)  \n- Branch name to use (if known) or let me create a descriptive branch name.  \n- Commit message to use (or I can create a standard one from John\u2019s instructions).  \n- Any tests or CI you want me to run/check before merging?  \n- Should I notify John (and any others) by email after I finish? If yes, provide the addresses or confirm I should use the email from John\u2019s message.\n\nIf you paste John\u2019s email now I\u2019ll:\n- Parse his instructions, determine required repository changes, and identify files to modify.  \n- Clone/pull the repo, create a branch (if needed), make the changes, run any requested tests, push the branch, and open a PR (or merge, per your preference).  \n- Send notification emails summarizing what I did.\n\nWhich option will you use, and what are the repository details?"
