I can\u2019t see John\u2019s instructions until you either paste/forward the email here or allow inbox access.\n\nTo move forward, please either:\n- Paste John\u2019s email text (or the specific instructions) into this chat, or\n- Forward John\u2019s email to me (if your environment supports that), or\n- Tell me the repository name and describe the change John asked for.\n\nWhat I can do once I have the instructions (examples of actions I can perform directly with your permission):\n- Create a new GitHub repo (git_create_repo)\n- Clone a repo (git_clone) and push changes (git_push)\n- Invite collaborators (git_invite_collaborators)\n- Transfer repo ownership (git_transfer_repo_ownership)\n- Create or update issues (git_issue)\n- Add or remove SSH keys (git_add_ssh_key / git_delete_ssh_key)\n- Star/unstar repos (git_star / git_unstar)\n\nIf John\u2019s instructions include specifics, tell me any required values (e.g., repo name, branch name, collaborator email, files or patch content). If you want me to act on your behalf in GitHub, include the repo name and the exact change you want me to make; I\u2019ll run the corresponding tool(s) and report back with results.\n\nWhich option do you prefer?"
