If private, paste or attach the changes.\n- Any deadlines or priority.\n\nIf you want, here are common quick actions I can do once you provide the info:\n- Clone/pull the repo, apply edits, commit, push, and open a PR.  \n- Invite or add collaborators.  \n- Create a release and attach files.  \n- Create or rename a repository.  \n\nPaste John\u2019s email or the requested details and I\u2019ll follow his instructions and carry out the update."
