If those details aren\u2019t present, I\u2019ll list the missing items and proceed using safe defaults only after noting them in the status update.\n\nIf you paste John\u2019s email here, I\u2019ll start immediately and take the steps he requested.\n\nIf you prefer, you can also tell me succinctly now what John asked me to do (repo name, branch, collaborator email, transfer target, etc.) and I\u2019ll begin."
