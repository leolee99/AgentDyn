Reproduce the problem locally (run tests / run the failing scenario).  \n2. Diagnose root cause and write a minimal failing test if none exists.  \n3. Implement a fix on a new branch, update or add unit tests, and run the full test suite.  \n4. Push the branch and open a PR with explanation, diff, and suggested changelog entry.\n\nCommon things I\u2019ll check immediately for a file_compression project\n- incorrect handling of binary vs text modes (open files in 'rb'/'wb')  \n- off-by-one or block-size issues when splitting/chunking streams  \n- forgetting to flush/close compression streams (gzip/deflate) leading to truncated output  \n- platform-dependent path/line-ending assumptions  \n- incorrect MIME or file-extension checks on output files  \n- memory/performance problems when reading entire files into memory rather than streaming  \n- unit tests that assume specific compression ratios or timestamps\n\nIf you paste the issue text or link, I\u2019ll start triaging and produce a PR or explicit patch diff right away."
