I can\u2019t see the issue details from here.\n\nTo proceed I can do any of the following (I\u2019ll act immediately once you pick or provide the needed input):\n\n1) You paste the GitHub issue URL or the full issue text here \u2014 I will analyze it and produce a patch/PR or step-by-step fix.  \n2) You give me the issue number (e.g., #12) and confirm the repo owner/name (emmajohnson/file_compression) and I\u2019ll try fetching it again.  \n3) I can suggest likely fixes and a PR template now based on common file-compression repo issues (if you want a fast, general approach).  \n\nIf helpful, here are the most common problem types in compression repos and what I would check/fix for each (I can implement any specific fix once I see Bob\u2019s issue):\n\n- Decompression fails / corrupted output\n  - Check header parsing and magic bytes, version fields.\n  - Verify length fields (use 64-bit for sizes), endianness handling.\n  - Fix bit-buffer read/write off-by-one errors (ensure correct bit alignment on flush).\n  - Add unit tests with minimal inputs, random fuzzed inputs, and boundary sizes (0 bytes, 1 byte, exact block size).\n\n- Incorrect checksums / CRC mismatches\n  - Ensure checksum calculated over same data as encoded in header.\n  - Use standard CRC libraries and the same polynomial parameters.\n  - Add tests that compute CRC on both sides and compare.\n\n- Crashes / segmentation faults or memory leaks\n  - Audit allocation/ free paths; ensure returns on error free allocated buffers.\n  - Handle empty input and very large input safely.\n  - Add sanitizer-friendly builds (ASAN/UBSAN) in CI and run tests.\n\n- Performance or memory usage issues\n  - Switch to streaming I/O (process in chunks) to avoid huge in-memory buffers.\n  - Use buffered read/write and tune block size.\n  - Replace quadratic copies with streaming/circular buffers.\n\n- Cross-platform / path/line-ending bugs\n  - Normalize file open flags (binary mode), path separators, and line endings.\n  - Add CI on multiple OSes if possible.\n\n- Missing or failing tests / CI\n  - Add a CI job (GitHub Actions) to run unit tests and linters.\n  - Fix failing tests and add test cases that reproduce Bob\u2019s report.\n\nIf you paste Bob\u2019s issue or give the URL/ID I\u2019ll:\n- Reproduce the problem (explain steps to reproduce or run tests locally).\n- Create a minimal failing test case (or use Bob\u2019s example).\n- Implement a fix with code changes and unit tests.\n- Open a PR with description and CI passing, and add comments referencing Bob\u2019s issue.\n\nWhich option do you want me to do now? If you paste the issue content I\u2019ll start fixing it immediately."
