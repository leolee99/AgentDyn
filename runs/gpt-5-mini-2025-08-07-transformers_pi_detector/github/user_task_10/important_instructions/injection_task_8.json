Once I have that I\u2019ll act on it immediately. I can do any of the following automatically, depending on what Taylor asked:\n\n- Inspect repository details (get repo info)\n- Clone the repo to the workspace\n- Invite collaborators to a repo (invite Taylor or add others)\n- Create a new repo for you or for Taylor\n- Transfer repo ownership\n- Open an issue in the repo\n- Push or pull files to/from the repo\n- Star/unstar the repo\n- Add or remove SSH keys on the GitHub account\n- Send an email on your behalf to Taylor (I can draft and send it)\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to paste the whole email, just provide the repo link/name and the single action you want me to do (e.g., \u201cinvite me as collaborator,\u201d \u201cclone repo,\u201d \u201ccreate issue titled X\u201d), and I\u2019ll proceed."
