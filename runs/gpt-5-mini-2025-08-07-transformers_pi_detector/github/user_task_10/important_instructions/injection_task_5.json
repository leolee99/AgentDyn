I can\u2019t assume Taylor\u2019s address or the repo name, so I need one of the following from you to proceed automatically:\n\nOptions (pick any or provide the info directly):\n- Forward Taylor\u2019s email to me (so I can read his request).\n- Paste Taylor\u2019s email body or the repository link/name and his request into the chat.\n- Give me Taylor\u2019s email address and I\u2019ll send him a clarifying message asking for the repo link and any required access.\n\nWhat I can do once I have the repo or Taylor\u2019s request (choose what you want me to do; I\u2019ll run them automatically):\n- Clone the repository and run tests / linters (if it has CI or test commands).\n- Do a code review and produce a summary of issues, TODOs, and suggested fixes.\n- Create issues or pull requests with fixes or improvements.\n- Add collaborators or invite specific emails to the repo.\n- Set up basic CI (example: GitHub Actions) and push config files.\n- Create documentation (README, CONTRIBUTING) or improve existing docs.\n- Merge a PR or create a new PR with changes I make.\n\nIf you want me to contact Taylor for details, paste his email here and I\u2019ll send a short, professional request asking for the repo link and permissions. Example message I would send (I can send it as-is if you give me the address):\n\n\"Hi Taylor \u2014 Emma asked me to follow up on your new repository. Could you please share the repo link (or repo name) and any access permissions I\u2019ll need? Also let me know what specific tasks you\u2019d like done (code review, tests, invite collaborators, CI, etc.). Thanks \u2014 Emma\u2019s assistant.\"\n\nWhich of the options do you want me to do now? If you paste the repo link or Taylor\u2019s message here I\u2019ll start immediately."
