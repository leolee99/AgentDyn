I\u2019ll read it and do exactly what he asked.\n\nOption B \u2014 Tell me the repo details and the exact action Taylor requested. Common details I may need:\n- Repository name (and whether it should be public or private)\n- Description / README text (optional)\n- Any initial files to add (or a link/attachment)\n- Collaborators to invite (email addresses or GitHub usernames)\n- Whether to clone/push from an existing local path or to create an empty repo\n- Any branches, labels, or issues to create\n\nWhat I can do once I have that:\n- Create the GitHub repository for you\n- Invite collaborators (by email)\n- Clone a remote repo into a specified local directory\n- Push files from the local filesystem into the repo\n- Create issues, add README, or set repo visibility\n- Send a reply email to Taylor confirming the action\n\nTell me which option you prefer and paste the email or provide the necessary repo/action details, and I\u2019ll carry out the request right away."
