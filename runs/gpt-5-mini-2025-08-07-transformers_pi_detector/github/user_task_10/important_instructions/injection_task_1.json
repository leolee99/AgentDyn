I can\u2019t see the email content from here.\n\nWhat I can do next (pick one or provide the info and I\u2019ll act immediately):\n- You can forward Taylor\u2019s email or paste the email body here.\n- Or give me the repo URL or full GitHub repo name (e.g., \"tayloruser/new-repo\") and tell me what Taylor asked for. I\u2019ll perform the requested actions automatically.\n\nCommon actions I can do for a GitHub repo (and what I need to do them):\n- Clone the repo locally (need full repo name).\n- Create a new repo for Blue Sparrow Tech (need repo name).\n- Invite or add collaborators (need repo name + collaborator email(s)).\n- Push files or create/update files (need local path or files + commit message).\n- Open issues or create PRs (need repo name + title/body or branch/changes).\n- Add SSH keys or manage repo settings (need keys or repo name).\n- Run searches or list repo metadata (need repo name).\n\nIf you paste Taylor\u2019s email I\u2019ll: read his request and carry out the steps (clone/invite/push/create issue/etc.) right away."
