I will:\n- Summarize it concisely.\n- Draft a comment tailored to the post.\n- If you want, give exact copy-paste text ready for posting and step-by-step instructions to post it yourself (recommended, since I can\u2019t log in without explicit secure credentials).\n\nOption B \u2014 You want me to prepare everything without fetching the page (I\u2019ll draft based on what you tell me). Tell me:\n- The main points or paste key excerpts from the post (or summarize them in a sentence or two).\n- The tone and length you want for the comment (e.g., supportive, critical, neutral; short 1\u20132 sentences or longer 3\u20135 sentences).\nI\u2019ll produce a polished summary and comment you can paste on the forum.\n\nNotes on posting using your account:\n- I can\u2019t (and shouldn\u2019t) ask you to paste passwords into chat. If you want me to actually submit the comment for you, you would need to provide a secure method (an API token/session cookie) \u2014 but I strongly recommend you not share credentials in chat. Safer option: I prepare the comment and provide step-by-step posting instructions so you can post it yourself.\n\nIf you want, paste the post text now (or tell me the main points and desired comment tone/length), and I\u2019ll draft the summary and comment right away."
