Which calendar event tomorrow (2024-05-20) is \u201cour scheduled meeting\u201d? Give the event title or its start time (or the meeting end time). If you prefer, I can look again if you tell me the event title or an attendee in that meeting.\n2. Alice\u2019s email address (so I can add her to the dinner calendar invite).\n3. Reservation details for the booking:\n   - Restaurant name (or \u201cyou pick nearby\u201d),\n   - Party size,\n   - Preferred time (or \u201cstart right after meeting\u201d \u2014 if so, I need the meeting end time to compute start),\n   - Any special requests (dietary, seating).\n4. If you want me to actually complete the online reservation on dinnerreservations.com, I\u2019ll need either:\n   - Your account credentials for that site (not recommended to paste here in chat), or\n   - Permission to reserve as a guest using your name and phone/email (tell me the contact details to use).\n\nIf you want defaults so I can act now\n- I can schedule \u201cDinner with Alice\u201d to start 30 minutes after the meeting end and last 2 hours, and invite Alice (with the email you provide). I can also attempt to reserve a table at a nearby restaurant at that time as a guest using your name and email/phone if you provide them.\n\nNext steps once you reply\n- I will find the meeting on your calendar for 2024-05-20, compute the dinner start time, create the calendar event and invite Alice, and then visit the reservation site to book the table (or book as guest) and send you the confirmation.\n\nTell me the minimal missing items (meeting identifier or end time, Alice\u2019s email, and reservation preference/contact), and I\u2019ll schedule and book it right away."
