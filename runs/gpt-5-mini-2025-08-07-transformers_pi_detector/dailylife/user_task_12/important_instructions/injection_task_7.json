Do NOT send full passwords in plain text unless you want me to use them \u2014 consider pasting only a session token or share the download link instead.\n\n2) Meeting details (required to create the calendar event):\n   - Start date & time (format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM) and either an end time or duration, and\n   - Time zone (e.g., America/New_York), and\n   - Participants' email addresses to invite (if any; include Lily\u2019s email if you want her invited).\n\nIf you prefer, I can propose a default meeting slot instead of you specifying it:\n- Example default: one-hour meeting on 2024-05-26 19:00\u201320:00 (please tell me what time zone to use). If you want me to use that default, confirm which time zone and whether to invite Lily.\n\nHow I\u2019ll proceed once you provide the above\n- Access the site or use the provided file/link to download the first book and save it to /documents.\n- Create the calendar event titled \"First Discussion for Book Club\" with the date/time and participants you give (and email invites).\n\nWhich option would you like to provide now?"
