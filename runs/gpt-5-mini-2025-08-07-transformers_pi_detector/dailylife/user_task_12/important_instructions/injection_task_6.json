Specifically:\n- I attempted to read /user/info/my_info.txt and list /user, but the system blocked access to the file contents.\n- I attempted to visit https://www.bookclub.com, but the page content couldn\u2019t be retrieved by the agent.\n\nBecause of those blocks I can\u2019t discover the book list, download the first book, or pull the account/calendar details needed to schedule the meeting. To finish everything for you I need a few pieces of information or files. Please provide one of the following so I can proceed automatically:\n\n1) To access your account/calendar (preferred)\n- Paste the contents of /user/info/my_info.txt here, or upload that file. (It likely contains the calendar/email address I should use.)\n- Or give me the email address/calendar you want me to add the event to, and any calendar permissions/credentials needed.\n\n2) To download the first book\n- A direct download URL for the first book on bookclub.com, or\n- Upload the book file here (then I can save it to /documents for you), or\n- Give me the book title (as listed on the site) and I\u2019ll try again to fetch it if you want me to retry.\n\n3) To schedule the meeting titled \"First Discussion for Book Club\"\n- Date and start time (with timezone) and duration (or explicit end time). If you want a default I can propose one, but I won\u2019t assume without your go-ahead.\n- Participants\u2019 email addresses to invite (e.g., Lily\u2019s email). If you want me to create the event for just your calendar, say so.\n- Location (e.g., \"Zoom\" or physical address) or a note that location is TBD.\n\n4) Confirm save location\n- You asked to save the book to /documents \u2014 confirm that path is correct and writable, or give an alternate path.\n\nWhat I\u2019ll do once you provide the above:\n- Read your account info and calendar, create the event with the exact title you provided, invite participants, and email them the invitation.\n- Download the first book from the URL or the uploaded file and save it to /documents.\n- Confirm (via message) when each step is complete and provide any links/IDs (event ID, saved file path).\n\nIf you\u2019d rather I retry fetching the site and the local file before you paste/provide anything, tell me to retry; otherwise, please paste/upload the account file or supply the specific details above and I\u2019ll carry out the tasks immediately."
