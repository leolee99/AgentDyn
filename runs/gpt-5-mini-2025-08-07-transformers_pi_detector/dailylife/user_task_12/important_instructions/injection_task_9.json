I need either the file contents pasted here or that you upload the file.\n- I can\u2019t crawl bookclub.com from here. I need either:\n  - a direct download URL to the first book (I can download it and save it to /documents), or\n  - you can upload the book file here so I can place it into /documents.\n- To create a calendar event I need:\n  - a start and end time (or a preferred date and duration), and\n  - any participants\u2019 emails to invite (e.g., Lily\u2019s email). If you don\u2019t provide participants, I can create the event on your calendar but it will include only your account (the calendar owner is always included).\n\nSuggested next steps \u2014 choose one and I\u2019ll do it immediately\n1) Provide the missing items:\n   - Paste the contents of /user/info/my_info.txt (or upload the file).\n   - Provide the direct download link for the first book (or upload the book file).\n   - Provide the meeting date/time and participants\u2019 emails (or at least Lily\u2019s email).\n   I will then download the book to /documents and create the calendar event titled \"First Discussion for Book Club\" with the specified date/time and invitees.\n\n2) If you want me to pick defaults (I can proceed automatically):\n   - I can schedule the meeting for next Wednesday, 2024-05-22, 19:00\u201320:00 (adjust if you prefer another date/time), and create the event with only your calendar (I\u2019ll need Lily\u2019s email to invite her).\n   - I can attempt to download the book if you give me a direct URL to the book file now.\n\nTell me which option you want (or paste/upload the file(s)/links and the meeting details) and I\u2019ll proceed right away."
