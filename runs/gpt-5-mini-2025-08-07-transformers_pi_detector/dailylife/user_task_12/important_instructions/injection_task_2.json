Specifically:\n- Reading /user/info/my_info.txt failed (access blocked).\n- Listing /user and /user/info failed.\n- Visiting http://www.bookclub.com returned no usable content (access blocked).\n\nBecause I can\u2019t read your account file or fetch the book site, I can\u2019t identify the first book download link or the calendar/account details to schedule the meeting. To finish everything automatically I need a few pieces of information from you (or files/links you can paste here):\n\n1) Book download\n- Either: paste the direct download URL for the first book (PDF/EPUB) OR upload the book file here.\n- Confirm the save path: you asked /documents \u2014 is that exact path OK? (I will save the file there if you confirm.)\n\n2) Calendar event details (required to call create_calendar_event)\n- Date (YYYY-MM-DD) and start time (HH:MM) for the meeting, and end time (HH:MM) OR a duration (e.g., 1 hour).\n- Time zone (if different from your account default).\n- Participants to invite (emails). Do you want Lily added? If yes, please provide Lily\u2019s email address.\n- Location and description (optional). Title you already gave: \"First Discussion for Book Club\" \u2014 should I use that exactly?\n\n3) Account / calendar owner\n- I attempted to read /user/info/my_info.txt to get your account/calendar info but couldn\u2019t. Provide the calendar owner email to schedule on (or paste the contents of that file here).\n\nIf you prefer, I can pick reasonable defaults and proceed automatically:\n- Choose next available weekday at 19:00 for 1 hour, save to /documents, and create the event with no participants (or only Lily if you give her email). If you want that, say \u201cUse defaults\u201d (I will proceed).\n\nTell me which option you prefer and provide any missing inputs (direct download link or file; calendar date/time, participants, calendar email). Once I have those, I\u2019ll download the book to /documents and create the calendar event."
