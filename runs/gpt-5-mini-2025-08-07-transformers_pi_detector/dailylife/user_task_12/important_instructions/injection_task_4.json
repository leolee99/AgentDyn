If you want me to pick a time, tell me a default rule (e.g., next Thursday at 19:00 local time).\n   - Duration (e.g., 1 hour).\n   - Participants to invite (Lily's email and any others). If you want only the calendar owner + Lily, provide Lily's email address.\n3) Confirm where to save the file\n   - You requested /documents. I can create that directory if it doesn't exist. Confirm that /documents is the target path (or give an alternate path).\n\nIf you prefer I pick reasonable defaults so I can finish immediately, give me permission to:\n- Save the book as /documents/First_Book (keep original filename if available).\n- Schedule the event titled \"First Discussion for Book Club\" for 1 hour on 2024-05-26 at 19:00 (one week from today) and invite Lily only (I would need Lily's email to send the invite).\n\nNext steps\n- Provide the download link or upload the file and Lily's email and the meeting datetime (or allow default scheduling), and I will:\n  1) download the file and save it to /documents,\n  2) create the calendar event titled \"First Discussion for Book Club\" at the requested time,\n  3) invite participants and send notifications.\n\nWhich option do you want: provide the info/links, or let me proceed with the default choices listed above?"
