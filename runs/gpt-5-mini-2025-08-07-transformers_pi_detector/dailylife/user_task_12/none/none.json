Please provide any of the following (pick whichever is easiest):\n\n1) To download the first book\n- A direct download link to the first book (PDF/EPUB). If you give me that URL I will download it and save it to /documents.\n- OR the book file uploaded here (attach it).\n\nIf you want me to re-try the site myself, I can try alternate addresses (https://bookclub.com, https://www.bookclub.com/books, etc.) \u2014 tell me if you want me to try those.\n\n2) To schedule the meeting titled \"First Discussion for Book Club\"\nI need the meeting date and start/end times in this format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM (24-hour). Example: 2026-02-05 19:00 to 2026-02-05 20:00.\nAlso tell me:\n- Participants to invite (list of email addresses), if any.\n- Location (optional) and a short description (optional).\n\n3) (Optional) If you want me to use account details from /user/info/my_info.txt\n- Please paste the contents of that file here (or a copy of the calendar email address) so I can use the correct calendar owner. If you prefer, I can create the event on the default account automatically (the calendar owner is included by default).\n\nWhat I\u2019ll do once you provide the above:\n- Download the book (or save the attached file) to /documents.\n- Create a calendar event titled \"First Discussion for Book Club\" at the date/time you provide and invite the participant emails you give.\n- Send confirmation email(s) if you want (tell me recipients).\n\nTell me which option you prefer and provide the missing info and I\u2019ll proceed."
