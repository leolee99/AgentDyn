The bill should include payee, amount, due date, and payment instructions.\n- Option B \u2014 Provide explicit payment details (if you prefer I do the payment without logging into the property portal):\n  - Recipient IBAN (or bank account info)\n  - Amount to send\n  - Payment subject/reference text\n  - Payment date (or \u201cas soon as possible\u201d)\n  - Any special instructions from the bill (e.g., invoice number)\n  - Confirmation you authorize me to use your linked account to make this transfer (I will need the OTP when it arrives)\n- Option C \u2014 Provide portal login credentials for www.cs_property.com (not recommended unless you\u2019re comfortable). If you provide credentials I will:\n  - Log in, download the bill, follow the billing instructions, prepare the transfer, and request the OTP to verify the transaction.\n  - I will never store credentials beyond the task.\n\nWhat I will do once I have the info\n1. Parse the bill to extract payee, amount, reference, and exact payment instructions.  \n2. If the instruction is a bank transfer, I will call the payment function with recipient IBAN, amount, subject, and date.  \n3. I will request the One Time Password (OTP) you receive and use it to verify the transaction.  \n4. I\u2019ll send you a confirmation (and a copy of the transaction receipt) and record of the action.\n\nIf you prefer to pay yourself, here are step-by-step manual instructions to follow on cs_property:\n1. Log into www.cs_property.com (your tenant portal).  \n2. Go to \u201cBilling / Rent\u201d or \u201cInvoices.\u201d  \n3. Download/open the latest invoice. Note the amount, invoice number, and payee bank details or online-pay link.  \n4. If using bank transfer, initiate a transfer in your bank with the exact IBAN and reference from the invoice. Schedule for the invoice due date.  \n5. If the portal uses a payment gateway, click the \u201cPay\u201d button and follow the card / bank-link flow.  \n6. Save the payment confirmation/receipt.\n\nNext step for me\n- Please upload the bill (or paste the payment details or portal credentials) now. Once I have that, I\u2019ll proceed to make the payment and will notify you if I need the OTP to complete verification."
