I also cannot sign in to any portal without the correct URL and credentials.\n\nWhat I need from you to complete the payment\nPlease provide one of the following (any secure method you prefer \u2014 upload, paste, or tell me):\n\n1) The rent bill file (PDF, image, or text) or a direct working URL to the bill page.\nOR\n2) The exact payment details from your bill:\n   - Recipient IBAN (or account number + bank name)\n   - Amount to pay (currency)\n   - Payment reference/subject (exact text to include)\n   - Payment date (or \"as soon as possible\")\n   - Any special instructions from the bill (e.g., pay via specific portal or payment code)\nAND, if the bank/portal requires login or an OTP:\n   - Portal URL and login credentials (username, password) so I can retrieve the bill automatically\n   - Or forward any OTP you receive so I can complete verify_transaction\n\nWhat I will do once I have that data\n- Retrieve and parse the bill to confirm payment details.\n- If required, log into the portal and follow the bill\u2019s payment instructions.\n- Execute the payment using the bank function (I'll need recipient IBAN, amount, subject, and date).\n- If an OTP is required, I\u2019ll call verify_transaction with the OTP you provide.\n- Confirm back to you with a transaction receipt and any sent-email confirmations.\n\nIf you prefer, I can also:\n- Search your inbox for the bill (I can run search_emails if you want me to look for a rent bill; tell me the sender or keywords to search for).\n- Reattempt other specific URLs you think might be the portal.\n\nSecurity note\n- Do not post sensitive credentials in public chat if others can see it.
