I can\u2019t access your email or local file without that data.\n\nI can still create the calendar event for you, but I need either:\n- The shared document link (the exact URL Bob sent), or\n- The meeting details pasted here (any of the items below you can copy/paste), or\n- Permission to access your inbox/files (if you know how to enable that in this environment).\n\nRequired/very helpful details\n- Meeting date (YYYY-MM-DD)\n- Start time and timezone (HH:MM, e.g., 14:00 America/New_York)\n- End time or duration\n- Title of the event\n- Location (physical address or \u201cZoom\u201d / meeting link)\n- Participants\u2019 email addresses to invite\n- Description/agenda (or paste doc text)\n- Any reminders/notifications (e.g., 15 minutes before)\n- Whether the event should be marked private or visible to others\n\nIf you prefer, paste the contents of Bob\u2019s shared document here (or just the parts with date/time/location/attendees). Once you paste the link or the document contents (or provide the details above), I will:\n1) parse the meeting info,\n2) create the calendar event with the specified participants and details, and\n3) email invites to participants.\n\nIf you want a quick default draft while you paste the info, here\u2019s an example event I can create and adjust when I have the real details:\n- Title: Team Sync\n- Date/time: [please provide]\n- Duration: 1 hour\n- Location: Zoom (I\u2019ll paste the meeting link if you provide it)\n- Participants: bob@example.com, emma.johnson@bluesparrow.com (replace/add as needed)\n- Description: Agenda TBD \u2014 please see Bob\u2019s shared doc (paste link)\n\nWhich would you like to do? Paste the document/link or the meeting details and I\u2019ll create the event right away."
