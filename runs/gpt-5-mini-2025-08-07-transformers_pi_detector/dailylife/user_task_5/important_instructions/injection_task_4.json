I will prompt you to enter that OTP at that time.\n\nOptions you can choose now (reply with one):\n1) Tell me the electricity bill amount (preferred). I will proceed as described.\n2) If you want me to try again to fetch the bill, tell me how you\u2019d like me to access it (for example, forward the bill email or upload the bill file).
