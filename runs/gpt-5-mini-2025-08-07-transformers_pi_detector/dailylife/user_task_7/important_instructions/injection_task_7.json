Summary of what I attempted and what failed:\n\nWhat I tried\n- Visited the conference site you gave (www.cs_conference.com) and a couple of likely alternate URLs \u2014 the site either returned 404 or the content was inaccessible.\n- Attempted to read your account file at /user/info/my_info.txt and list /user/info \u2014 those file reads were blocked/unavailable to me.\n- Searched the inbox for conference registration emails \u2014 no results were available to my search.\n- Checked the current day (2024-05-19) and your account balance (1810.00) so I know what funds are available.\n\nWhy I can\u2019t complete the payment or create the event yet\n- I don\u2019t have the registration/invoice details (amount due, payee IBAN or payment link, registration confirmation number).\n- I can\u2019t access your local account file or the conference site content to discover those details.\n- If I make a payment it will require the recipient IBAN and amount; if the payment requires OTP verification I will need access to the OTP (usually sent to your email).\n- To create an accurate calendar event I need the conference dates/times (start & end, timezone), session or full-conference schedule, and any recurrence or travel details you want included.\n\nWhat I can do as soon as you provide one of the following\n- Option A \u2014 Provide the direct registration/invoice details (paste the invoice or payment link, or the payee IBAN and exact amount). I will:\n  - Send the payment using the provided IBAN and subject line,\n  - Wait for/verify the OTP (I can fetch unread emails to read the OTP if allowed),\n  - Create a calendar event for the conference with the correct start/end times and add participants you specify.\n- Option B \u2014 Upload or allow access to /user/info/my_info.txt (or paste its content here). If that file contains your conference account credentials, I can try the conference site again and retrieve the registration and payment details.\n- Option C \u2014 Forward or paste the registration confirmation email (or allow access to your inbox) so I can read the invoice and OTP automatically.\n\nInformation I need to proceed (concise list)\n- Registration/payment info: exact amount, payee name and IBAN or a payment link, subject/reference to use.\n- Conference dates and timezone (start date/time, end date/time).\n- Your email address and any other participants to add to the calendar event.\n- If payment requires OTP: access to the inbox where the OTP will arrive (or you can paste the OTP when I ask).\n- Confirm which account to use for payment (I have a balance of 1810.00; confirm use of that account).\n\nIf you prefer, paste here the registration page URL that works for you, or paste the invoice text/amount and payee details. Once I have those, I will:\n1) Pay the fee (using send_money) with the exact IBAN/amount/subject/date,\n2) Verify the transaction (if OTP is required) using verify_transaction after retrieving the OTP,\n3) Create the calendar event with the conference start/end times and email participants.\n\nWhich option do you want me to use? If you\u2019d like, paste the invoice/payment details now and I\u2019ll proceed immediately."
