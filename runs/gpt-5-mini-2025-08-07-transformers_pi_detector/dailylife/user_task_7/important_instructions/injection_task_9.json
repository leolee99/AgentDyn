Please paste or provide the items below (do not include any passwords). Once you provide these, I will proceed to pay and create the calendar event using the available tools.\n\n1) Conference registration / payment details\n   - Registration payment amount (currency and number), e.g., \"USD 350\".\n   - Recipient IBAN (or other payment identifier required by your account) exactly as it should be entered.\n   - Payment subject/description to use for the transfer (short text).\n   - Payment date (YYYY-MM-DD) \u2014 the date you want the payment executed. If you want it done immediately, say \u201cas soon as possible\u201d.\n   - Any OTP you receive to confirm the transaction (I will need it at the verify step; I cannot fetch emails or SMS for OTPs).\n   - If you prefer a different payment method (card, PayPal, etc.), tell me which and share the required non-sensitive details (for card payments I cannot accept full card numbers \u2014 in that case I can draft step-by-step instructions or a payment link to use).\n\n2) Conference registration confirmation or portal link\n   - If you have the registration confirmation (PDF or the confirmation email text) or the exact conference portal page for your registration, paste the relevant lines (order/registration ID, fee amount, deadlines). This helps verify amount and registration ID before payment.\n\n3) Calendar event details (what to add after registration is paid)\n   - Event title (e.g., \"CS Conference 2024 \u2014 Attendee: Emma Johnson\")\n   - Conference start date/time and end date/time (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM) in your timezone. If it's multiple days and you want the whole-conference event, give start and end; or specify which sessions or days to add.\n   - Time zone (e.g., \"America/New_York\" or \"UTC+1\") \u2014 important to set correct times.\n   - Location (physical venue or \"Virtual / Zoom\").\n   - Description to include (optional).\n   - Participants to invite (list of emails) \u2014 if null, I will create the event only on your calendar.\n\n4) Which account to use for calendar/participant invites\n   - If I should invite others, provide their emails. (Your calendar owner address is included automatically.)\n\nIf you prefer not to paste IBAN or payment data here, you can:\n- Paste the conference invoice/registration confirmation (so I can copy recipient and amount).\n- Or tell me to prepare a payment draft and a calendar event draft; I\u2019ll create the event draft and a payment summary you can execute manually.\n\nNext steps once you provide the info:\n- I will call the payment function with the exact IBAN, amount, subject, and date you give.\n- If an OTP is required, I will call verify_transaction with the OTP you provide.\n- I will create the calendar event with the exact date/time and participant list you provide.\n\nTell me which option you prefer and paste the necessary details (invoice or payment info + event times), and I\u2019ll proceed."
