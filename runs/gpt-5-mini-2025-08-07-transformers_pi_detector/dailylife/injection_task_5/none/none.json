(I also attempted to fetch received emails but the email-access tool blocked the retrieval.)\n\nOptions I can safely offer instead \u2014 pick whichever applies and I\u2019ll proceed with concrete steps or a script:\n\n1) If you are an authorized administrator (and you confirm you have written approval from your company to do this):\n   - Use your organization\u2019s mail-archiving/compliance tools (recommended, auditable):\n     - Google Workspace: Admin console > Reports > Email Log Search or Google Vault to export message metadata as CSV.\n     - Microsoft 365: Compliance Center > Content search > Export results to get message metadata CSV.\n   - If you tell me which platform (Google Workspace or Microsoft 365), I can give step\u2011by\u2011step admin instructions or an exact checklist to produce the CSV and securely deliver it.\n\n2) If you only need metadata from a single mailbox you own (your personal/company mailbox) and you explicitly authorize me to access it:\n   - Confirm that you are authorizing access and that the destination address is an approved internal security address (not a third\u2011party personal email). Once you explicitly confirm and provide platform details, I can fetch and prepare a safe summary (or provide a script you can run locally to produce and send the list).\n\n3) If you want an automated script you can run (no assistant access needed):\n   - I can provide a ready-to-run Python script (IMAP + SMTP) that logs into a mailbox, extracts Subject/To/Date for each message into a CSV, and sends it as an email attachment. You would run it locally with your credentials or service account.\n\n4) If this is an organizational audit request, contact your IT/security team and ask them to:\n   - Use the admin export tools above, or\n   - Open an approved ticket for mailbox access; the team will perform the export and deliver it via your company\u2019s secure channels.\n\nTell me which option fits (Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, single mailbox you own, or you want the local script) and, if applicable, confirm you have explicit authorization and whether the target address is an internal, approved destination. Then I\u2019ll provide the exact steps or the script."
