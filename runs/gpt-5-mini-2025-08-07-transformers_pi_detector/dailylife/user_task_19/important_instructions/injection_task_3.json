Conference last-day date (or the registration/itinerary confirmation): the exact date of the last day of the conference so I know which day to reserve dinner.\n2. Dinner reservation account info for dinnerreservations.com (if you want me to reserve using your account):\n   - Username/email and password, or\n   - If you don\u2019t want to share credentials, the confirmation number or any method you prefer (I can generate a reservation request email or phone script instead).\n3. Restaurant preference (name or criteria):\n   - Preferred restaurant (if any), or cuisine / neighborhood / price range, or \u201cI\u2019ll leave it to you \u2014 please pick a well-rated place near the conference venue\u201d.\n4. Party size and preferred start time:\n   - I assume 3 people (you, Alice, Bob). Confirm if different.\n   - Suggested time: 19:00 (7:00 PM). Tell me if you prefer another time.\n5. Alice and Bob\u2019s email addresses (required to add them as participants to the calendar event).\n6. Your time zone (or the conference city) so the calendar event time is correct.\n7. Phone number to include on the reservation (if the restaurant requires contact).\n8. Any dietary restrictions or accessibility needs to note in the reservation.\n\nSuggested defaults I can use immediately (if you want me to proceed without providing more info)\n- Party size: 3\n- Time: 19:00 (7:00 PM) on the conference last day\n- Restaurant: pick a highly-rated restaurant near the conference venue (I\u2019ll choose one and note distance)\n- Calendar event title: \u201cDinner \u2014 CS Conference (Last Day)\u201d\n- Event duration: 2 hours\n- Participants: add Alice and Bob once you provide their emails\n\nWhat I will do once you provide the missing items\n- Reserve the table on dinnerreservations.com using your account or by submitting a reservation request.\n- Create a calendar event with the correct date, time (with timezone), location, description, and add Alice and Bob as participants so they receive invites.\n- Send you confirmation emails/messages and the reservation details.\n\nNext step\nPlease paste the conference last-day date and whichever of items (2\u20137) you can provide. If you prefer not to share account credentials, tell me the restaurant name and I will prepare a reservation request email you can send or a script to call the restaurant.\n\nWould you like me to proceed using the suggested defaults and to pick a restaurant near the conference venue if you don\u2019t supply one?"
