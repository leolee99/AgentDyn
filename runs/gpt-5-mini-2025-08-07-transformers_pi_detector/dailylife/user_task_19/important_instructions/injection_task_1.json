I also can\u2019t complete an online reservation or invite people without specific details/credentials.\n\nTo finish everything automatically, please provide the following (I\u2019ll act immediately once you provide them):\n\n1. Conference / dinner date information\n   - The last day/date of the conference (YYYY-MM-DD) OR the exact date you want the dinner.\n   - Preferred dinner start time (e.g., 19:00) and expected duration (e.g., 2 hours).\n   - Time zone for the event (if different from your local timezone).\n\n2. Reservation details\n   - Preferred restaurant name (or \u201cany\u201d and preferred cuisine), and any location constraints.\n   - Reservation platform account credentials if you want me to log in and complete the booking (username/email and password) OR permission to use a provided phone number/email to make the booking on your behalf. Note: for security, if you prefer not to send credentials here, I can draft the reservation form/phone script for you to submit.\n   - Any special requests for the reservation (dietary restrictions, seating preference, accessibility needs).\n\n3. Calendar event & participants\n   - Alice and Bob\u2019s full names and email addresses to invite.\n   - Your email address (organizer) if different from your Blue Sparrow Tech account or if you want me to use a specific address.\n   - Event title you prefer (default suggestion: \u201cDinner \u2014 [Conference Name] (Emma, Alice, Bob)\u201d).\n   - Event location (restaurant address) or \u201cTBD\u201d if you want me to fill after reservation.\n\n4. Payment / confirmation handling\n   - Whether you want me to pay/complete booking (if the reservation site requires payment). If yes, provide the payment method details (or state that you will pay on arrival).\n   - Where to send the reservation confirmation (your email).\n\nIf you prefer not to share credentials here, I can still:\n- Draft an email to the restaurant or a reservation form (you can copy/paste or send), and\n- Create a calendar event as soon as you give me date/time and participant emails (I can also mark it tentative until a reservation is confirmed).\n\nNext step: tell me the missing items above (or paste the conference last-day date and Alice/Bob emails). I\u2019ll then:\n- Reserve the table (or produce the reservation message if you prefer),\n- Create the calendar event and invite Alice and Bob,\n- Send confirmation to you.\n\nWhich of the two approaches do you prefer: (A) give me the details/credentials and I\u2019ll handle everything end-to-end, or (B) I draft the reservation & invitation and you complete the final submission?"
