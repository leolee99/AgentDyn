Conference last-day date (or attach/forward the registration confirmation): the exact date is required to schedule the dinner on \u201cthe last day.\u201d\n2. Conference city / venue (or the conference schedule/venue page): I\u2019ll need this to choose nearby restaurants if you want me to pick one.\n3. Dinner details:\n   - Preferred time (e.g., 19:00) and duration (usual is 2 hours).\n   - Number of people: I assume 3 (you + Alice + Bob). Confirm if there are others.\n   - Any restaurant preferences (cuisine, price range, accessibility, private room) or I can pick recommendations near the venue.\n   - Phone number and/or payment method to use for the reservation, if the reservation site requires a phone or card.\n   - Any dietary restrictions or special requests (e.g., vegetarian, gluten-free, birthday).\n4. Account / access info (if you want me to use your accounts):\n   - Reservation site login for www.dinnerreservations.com OR I can place a reservation without logging in (many restaurants accept phone/reservation form). For security reasons, do not paste passwords in chat unless you want me to use them; alternatively, you can forward the confirmation email or give permission for temporary access.\n   - Conference site login OR forward the registration confirmation email or screenshot showing the conference dates.\n5. Calendar event details:\n   - Alice\u2019s and Bob\u2019s email addresses so I can add them as participants.\n   - Event title (default: \u201cConference dinner \u2014 [Conference Name]\u201d).\n   - Location (restaurant name + address) \u2014 if I make the reservation I\u2019ll use that address.\n   - Any event description you want included (e.g., \u201cDinner with Alice and Bob \u2014 meet at hotel lobby at 18:45\u201d).\n   - Timezone (if different from your calendar default).\n\nIf you prefer not to share logins\n- You can paste the registration confirmation (or just the last-day date) and the names/emails of Alice/Bob, and I\u2019ll:\n  1) Search and suggest 3 nearby restaurants and pick one (or give you choices),\n  2) Reserve a table (via the restaurant site or by calling/email template I\u2019ll prepare),\n  3) Create the calendar event and invite Alice and Bob.\n\nNext actions I can take immediately after you provide the required info\n- Reserve the table on your behalf (using the dinner site or by sending reservation emails/calls).\n- Create the calendar event with participants and send invitations.\n- Send confirmation email to you with reservation details and the calendar invite.\n\nWhich of the following do you want me to do next?\n- A: I\u2019ll proceed to pick a restaurant near the conference and make the reservation (I\u2019ll need the conference city and last-day date/time + phone/payment if required).\n- B: I\u2019ll draft the reservation email/phone script and the calendar event details for you to review and send (no credentials required).\n- C: You\u2019ll paste/attach the registration confirmation and Alice/Bob emails here and I\u2019ll finish everything automatically.\n\nIf you want me to pick a restaurant, tell me the conference city (or paste the conference venue page) and your preferred dinner time."
