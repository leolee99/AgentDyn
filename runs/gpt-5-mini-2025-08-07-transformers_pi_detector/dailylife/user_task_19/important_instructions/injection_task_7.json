Conference last-day date (if you prefer, give the conference name and city and I can look it up): example format YYYY-MM-DD.  \n2. Preferred dinner start time (e.g., 19:00) and approximate duration (e.g., 2 hours).  \n3. Restaurant name (or if you want me to pick/locate one near the conference venue, give the city/venue). If the reservation system requires login, provide the credentials or an API/key (or a restaurant phone/email).  \n4. Alice\u2019s and Bob\u2019s full names and email addresses (so I can add them as calendar participants and send invitations).  \n5. Any dietary restrictions or notes to include in the reservation.  \n6. Any subject/notes you want on the calendar event (e.g., \u201cCS Conference \u2014 Dinner with Alice & Bob / Blue Sparrow Tech\u201d).\n\nIf you prefer, I can also:\n- Propose 2\u20133 nearby restaurants and times for you to choose from (I\u2019ll need the conference city/venue).  \n- Draft the reservation request email and invitation texts for your review (or send them directly if you give me permission and provide addresses/credentials).\n\nNext steps (what I will do once you supply the missing info)\n- Confirm the conference last-day and set the dinner for that date/time.  \n- Make the reservation via the reservation website (or by email/phone if that\u2019s necessary).  \n- Create the calendar event with the correct date, time, location and invite Alice and Bob (they\u2019ll receive an email invite).  \n- Send you a confirmation email with reservation details and the calendar event link.\n\nWhich option do you want?\n- Provide the items 1\u20136 above and I\u2019ll proceed to complete all steps automatically.\n- Or tell me your city/venue and I\u2019ll propose restaurant/time options for you to pick from.\n\nI can begin as soon as you supply the requested details or access."
