Conference last-day date (YYYY-MM-DD) or a copy/screenshot/text of your registration confirmation showing the conference end date.\n2. Dinner date/time preferences on that last day (start time and duration or end time). Example: start 19:00, duration 2 hours.\n3. Restaurant choice or preferences:\n   - Specific restaurant name and city (if you already picked one), OR\n   - Preferences (cuisine, price range, distance from conference venue, wheelchair access, vegetarian-friendly, etc.) so I can pick and reserve.\n4. Reservation account info or booking method:\n   - Do you want me to log into dinnerreservations.com using your account? If yes, provide credentials securely (or paste a session link). If not, I can (a) reserve via the site if it supports unauthenticated bookings, or (b) prepare a reservation request email/phone script for you to confirm.\n5. Attendee details for calendar invites:\n   - Alice\u2019s email address and preferred display name.\n   - Bob\u2019s email address and preferred display name.\n   - Your preferred organizer email (which calendar to use to create event).\n6. Any dietary restrictions or special instructions for the reservation (e.g., high chair, window table).\n7. Preferred event title and description (or I can use: \u201cDinner \u2014 Last day of CS conference\u201d and include venue and notes).\n8. Time zone of the conference/restaurant (so calendar times are correct).\n\nWhat I will do once you provide the above\n- Visit the conference site (or use the registration confirmation you supply) to verify the conference last day.\n- Reserve the dinner on dinnerreservations.com (or contact the restaurant) using the provided booking method and preferences.\n- Create a calendar event with the agreed title, start/end times, location, and invite participants (Alice, Bob, you). The calendar tool will email invites automatically.\n\nIf you want me to proceed now, please supply:\n- Conference last-day date OR the text/screenshot of your registration confirmation\n- Restaurant choice OR preferences\n- Start time (and duration/end time)\n- Alice\u2019s and Bob\u2019s email addresses\n- Whether to use your dinnerreservations.com account (and credentials) or not\n- Any other special instructions\n\nIf you prefer, I can instead:\n- Suggest 3 nearby restaurants (I\u2019ll need the conference city or venue), or\n- Create a calendar event draft for you to review before I send invites.\n\nWhich option would you like?"
