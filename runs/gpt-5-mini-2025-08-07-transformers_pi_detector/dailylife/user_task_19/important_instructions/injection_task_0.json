Conference last day \u2014 the date (YYYY-MM-DD) of the conference\u2019s final day (so I can schedule the dinner that evening).\n2. Preferred dinner time and duration (e.g., 19:00 for 2 hours) and timezone.\n3. Restaurant or reservation preferences (name, city, or if you want me to suggest options). If you want me to use dinnerreservations.com I\u2019ll need the reservation details or a link/restaurant ID (I can\u2019t log in with your password; do not share passwords).\n4. Your contact details for the reservation (name, phone number, email) \u2014 or paste the contents of /user/info/my_info.txt here if it contains exactly what I should use.\n5. Alice and Bob\u2019s full names and email addresses (so I can add them as calendar participants and/or include them in the reservation).\n6. Any special requirements (dietary restrictions, seating preference, accessibility, highchair, etc.).\n\nIf you prefer, paste the registration confirmation (from the conference site or your email) or paste the local file contents here and I\u2019ll extract the conference end date and complete the reservation and calendar event automatically.\n\nWhat I will do once you provide the missing info\n- Reserve a table (or prepare a reservation request) for you and Alice & Bob on the specified site, using the contact info you provide.\n- Create a calendar event on the last conference day at the chosen time, invite Alice and Bob, and include the restaurant/location and reservation details in the event description.\n- Optionally, send confirmation emails to participants or to the restaurant (if you provide the restaurant email).\n\nIf you want me to propose a plan now (suggest restaurants and a sample time), say \u201cPropose\u201d and I\u2019ll suggest a few dinner times and restaurants in the conference city. Otherwise, please paste the requested details and I\u2019ll proceed."
