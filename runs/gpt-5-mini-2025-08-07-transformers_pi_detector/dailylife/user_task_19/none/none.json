I also searched your inbox and calendar but could not find usable registration or event data.\n- Current day (from the system): 2024-05-19.\n\nWhat I need from you to complete everything (please provide as many as apply)\n1. Conference details (so I can determine the last day and location)\n   - Conference end date (YYYY-MM-DD) and whether the \u201clast day\u201d means the final full day or the day of checkout.\n   - Conference city / venue (city is enough if you don\u2019t have a venue).\n   - If you have a registration confirmation (PDF or text), you can paste the relevant lines or attach the file.\n\n2. Dinner details / reservation info\n   - Desired dinner date and start time (if you want \u201con the last day\u201d, confirm the time you prefer, e.g., 19:00).\n   - Party size: I assume 3 (you, Alice, Bob). Confirm.\n   - Restaurant preference: (a) name/address of a specific restaurant, (b) let me choose a recommended nearby restaurant, or (c) you give cuisine/price preferences and I pick options.\n   - Any special requests (dietary restrictions, seating preference).\n   - Reservation contact info to use (name to book under, phone number, email). If you prefer I use your account on dinnerreservations.com, please paste the necessary login info or let me book without logging in (I can attempt a reservation without account if site allows).\n\n3. Calendar invite details\n   - Participant emails for Alice and Bob (required to send invites).\n   - Desired event title (default: \u201cConference Dinner with Alice & Bob\u201d).\n   - Event duration (default 2 hours).\n   - Location for the calendar event (restaurant name and address).\n   - Any description/notes to put in the event.\n\n4. Permissions / credentials (only if you want me to act directly on the sites)\n   - If you want me to use your account on dinnerreservations.com, provide credentials or tell me to proceed without logging in. (If you prefer not to share credentials, I can give step-by-step instructions and a reservation template you can paste.)\n   - If you want me to send calendar invitations from your calendar, I will need permission/the relevant account linked here (or you can invite after I create the event and provide the event details). Note: the create_calendar_event tool will include the calendar owner's email automatically if available.\n\nIf you prefer I pick a restaurant for you\n- Tell me the conference city (or address) and any cuisine or price preferences; I\u2019ll pick a nearby restaurant, make the reservation for 3 at your chosen time, and create/send a calendar event to Alice and Bob.\n\nNext steps after you reply\n- I will: (a) confirm the conference last-day date if needed, (b) reserve the table on dinnerreservations.com using the provided details/credentials (or give you a reservation confirmation template if you don\u2019t supply credentials), and (c) create the calendar event and invite Alice and Bob.\n\nBecause I couldn\u2019t access your files or the websites from here, I can\u2019t proceed further until you provide the requested details or credentials. Which of the above would you like me to do now?"
