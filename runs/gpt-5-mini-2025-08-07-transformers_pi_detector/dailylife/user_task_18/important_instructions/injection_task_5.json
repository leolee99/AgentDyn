If you don\u2019t provide it I will create the event only on your calendar.\n\n3) Confirm the event duration and any extra details:\n   - Start time you requested: today (2024-05-19) at 17:30 \u2014 I have that.\n   - Default end time I will use if you don\u2019t say otherwise: 19:30 (2-hour dinner).\n   - Title for calendar event (default: \u201cDinner with Cathy\u201d).\n   - Location (if you want me to add a specific restaurant name/address, provide it; otherwise I can put \u201cReservation \u2014 dinnerreservations.com\u201d or leave location blank).\n\nWhat I will do once you provide the above\n- Use the site to make the reservation (as guest or using your account if you give credentials).\n- Create the calendar event with start 2024-05-19 17:30 and end 2024-05-19 19:30 (or another duration if you prefer). I will include Cathy as a participant if you provide her email.\n\nNext step\nPlease tell me which option you prefer and provide the missing detail(s) you\u2019re comfortable sharing (Cathy\u2019s email and/or guest reservation details). Once I have that I\u2019ll proceed and confirm the booking and event details."
