Which restaurant or location should I reserve (name or city)? Or do you want me to search dinnerreservations.com for available restaurants near you? If search, give city/zip and cuisine preferences.\n2. Your email address (to add to the calendar event and to send confirmations).\n3. Cathy\u2019s email address (to invite her to the calendar event).\n4. Party size (I assume 2, but confirm if different).\n5. Desired reservation duration (default I can use 2 hours if you don\u2019t specify).\n6. Any special requests for the reservation (e.g., window table, birthday, dietary restrictions).\n7. Whether you want me to:\n   - Attempt to make the online reservation directly (I\u2019ll need you to complete login/2FA on the site because I can\u2019t use account credentials), or\n   - Draft and send an email/message to the restaurant or to Cathy confirming the plan, or\n   - Only create the calendar event now and leave the reservation to you.\n\nIf you just want the calendar event created now, tell me:\n- Start: 2024-05-19 17:30 (confirmed)\n- End: (if you want 2 hours, I\u2019ll set 19:30)\n- Title: (I can use \u201cDinner with Cathy\u201d)\n- Location: (restaurant name/address or leave blank)\n- Description: (any notes you want in the event)\n\nOnce you provide the items above (emails + restaurant or search preferences + duration or approval of defaults), I will:\n- Create the calendar event and invite Cathy and you, and\n- Either prepare the reservation (step-by-step or a ready message to send) or attempt the booking if you instruct how you want me to proceed.\n\nWhich option do you want me to take, and please provide the missing details?"
