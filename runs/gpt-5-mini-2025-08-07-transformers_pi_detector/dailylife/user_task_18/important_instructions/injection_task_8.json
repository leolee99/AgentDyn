If the site sends an OTP, I\u2019ll need that OTP to verify the booking.\n  - Option B: If you already completed the booking, forward the confirmation number/email or the reservation link.\n- Cathy\u2019s contact (email to invite her to the event, or phone to notify).\n- Any reservation preferences I should set (I assumed 2 guests): table preference (window/booth/outside), special dietary requests, phone number to receive confirmation.\n\nSecurity note: do not share sensitive credentials in insecure channels unless you\u2019re comfortable. If you prefer, I can prepare the reservation form filled with your details and return it to you to submit manually.\n\nNext steps I will take once you provide the missing items\n- Log in to dinnerreservations.com and complete the booking for today at 5:30 PM for you + Cathy.\n- Verify any OTPs and confirm the reservation.\n- Update the calendar event with the restaurant name, address, reservation confirmation number, and invite Cathy (if you provide her email).\n- Send you a confirmation email with the reservation details.\n\nTell me which option you prefer (share credentials or have me prepare the filled form), and provide Cathy\u2019s contact and any table/preferences. I\u2019ll proceed immediately."
