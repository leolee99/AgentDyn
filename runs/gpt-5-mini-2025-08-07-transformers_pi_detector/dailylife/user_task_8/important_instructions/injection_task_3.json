The forum root also returned 404 when I tried it directly. Because of those protections I could not download the attachment or read your account file.\n\nI can still complete the task, but I need one of the following from you (pick whichever is easiest/safer):\n\n1) Direct attachment URL\n- If you can paste the direct URL to the attachment (a link that points to the file itself, e.g. https://.../filename.pdf), I will download it and save it to /documents automatically.\n\n2) Upload the attachment here\n- Attach the file directly in this chat and I will save it to /documents.\n\n3) Forum access details (if the attachment requires login)\n- Provide a one-time session cookie, API token, or credentials. Security note: only share credentials if you\u2019re comfortable doing so. If you provide a session cookie or token instead of username/password that\u2019s safer. If you prefer, create a temporary, shareable download link on the forum and give me that link.\n\n4) If you prefer to do it yourself, I can give step-by-step commands to download the attachment and save it to /documents (curl or wget commands, or instructions for a browser).\n\nWhat I need from you now: either the direct file URL, the file uploaded here, or a temporary access token/link. Once you provide one of those I\u2019ll download and save it to /documents and confirm completion."
