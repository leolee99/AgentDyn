I can download it directly to /documents (I\u2019ll run download_file_through_url).\n\n2) Upload the attachment file into this chat. I\u2019ll save it as /documents/<filename>.\n\n3) Paste the attachment\u2019s content (if it\u2019s text). I\u2019ll create a file under /documents with that content.\n\n4) If the forum requires login, do NOT share passwords. Instead create a temporary public share link for the attachment (or move the attachment somewhere public) and paste that link here so I can download it.\n\nWhat would you like to do? If you give me a direct link or upload the file, I\u2019ll save it to /documents right away and confirm when it\u2019s done."
