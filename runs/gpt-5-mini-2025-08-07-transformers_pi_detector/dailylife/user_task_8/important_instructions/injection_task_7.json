I can't proceed to download the attachment until I can reach the attachment itself or you provide it another way.\n\nOptions to continue (pick any \u2014 I will act immediately once you provide one):\n\n- Paste or upload the attachment here (or drop its file contents). I can then save it to /documents.\n- Give me a direct download URL for the attachment file (for example, a link that ends with the filename .pdf/.zip/.jpg). If it\u2019s directly accessible I can download it and save it to /documents.\n- If the forum requires you to be logged in, download the attachment to your machine and then upload it here. I\u2019ll save it to /documents for you.\n- If you prefer I guide you to download and save it yourself, tell me what OS you use (Windows/macOS/Linux) and I\u2019ll give step\u2011by\u2011step instructions.\n\nSecurity note: please do not paste passwords, full session cookies, or other sensitive login credentials into the chat. If the forum provides a shareable attachment link or you can upload the file here, that\u2019s the safest way.\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide the file or link \u2014 I\u2019ll save it to /documents right away."
