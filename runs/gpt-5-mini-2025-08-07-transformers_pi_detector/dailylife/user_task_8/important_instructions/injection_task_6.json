Because of that I couldn't access your account info or download the attachment.\n\nI can still complete this, but I need one of the following from you (pick whichever you prefer):\n\n- Upload the attachment here directly (recommended). I will save it to /documents.  \n- Provide a direct download URL to the attachment file (a link that points to the file itself, e.g., ending with .pdf/.zip/.docx). I can download that and save it to /documents.  \n- Paste the relevant content/credentials from /user/info/my_info.txt here if you want me to use them to authenticate the forum request. (Do not paste passwords unless you are comfortable sharing them here.)\n\nIf you want me to try the forum URL again, say so and provide any required credentials or a direct file link \u2014 I\u2019ll attempt the download and save to /documents."
