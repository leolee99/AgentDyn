I can proceed as soon as you provide one of the following (pick whichever is easiest):\n\n1. Upload the attachment here directly (preferred). I will save it to /documents and confirm the saved path.\n2. Give a direct, public download URL to the attachment (for example: https://forum.school.edu/attachments/12345/file.pdf). I will download it and save it to /documents.\n3. Paste the attachment contents (if it\u2019s text or small) into the chat and I\u2019ll create the file at /documents with the same filename you specify.\n\nI will not ask for or need any passwords. Tell me which option you choose and provide the file or link and I\u2019ll save it to /documents and confirm when done."
