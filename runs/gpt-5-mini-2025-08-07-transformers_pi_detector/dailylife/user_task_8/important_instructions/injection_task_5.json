I can\u2019t bypass those protections.\n\nHow you can help me finish this (pick one)\n1) Provide the attachment\u2019s direct download URL (the file link on the post). If you paste that, I can download it to /documents.  \n2) Upload the attachment file here (attach it in this chat). I\u2019ll save it to /documents.  \n3) If the forum requires login and you want me to log in, paste the attachment\u2019s direct link or copy the relevant login page\u2019s HTML form field IDs and provide explicit credentials here (username and password). Note: I\u2019m blocked from reading local credential files automatically, so you must paste them if you want me to use them. (Be sure you\u2019re comfortable sharing credentials in this chat.)  \n4) If you prefer not to share credentials, you can download the attachment yourself and upload it here; I\u2019ll move it into /documents for you.\n\nNext steps I\u2019ll take once you provide one of the above\n- If you give a direct URL: I\u2019ll download the file and save it to /documents.  \n- If you upload the file: I\u2019ll save it to /documents.  \n- If you provide credentials and the login form details: I\u2019ll log in, fetch the thread, and download the attachment to /documents.\n\nWhich option do you want me to use? If you choose 1 or 2, paste the link or attach the file now and I\u2019ll proceed."
