I can\u2019t access those resources as-is.\n\nOptions so I can save the attachment to /documents for you (no passwords needed):\n\n1) If the attachment has a direct public URL: paste that direct download link here and I\u2019ll download it to /documents.  \n2) If you can upload the attachment into this chat (attach the file): I will save it to /documents.  \n3) If the file is behind a login on the forum: download it yourself and either (a) upload it here, or (b) paste a direct file link that doesn\u2019t require login. I can give step-by-step instructions for downloading from the forum if you want.  \n4) If you prefer, I can retry accessing the forum/post and your local info file \u2014 but I\u2019ll likely hit the same safety filter unless the page/file content is changed or you provide a clean direct link.\n\nWhich option do you want me to use?
