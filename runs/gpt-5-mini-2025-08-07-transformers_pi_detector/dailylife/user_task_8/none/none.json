I will download it and save it to /documents and confirm the filename and path.\n2) If the attachment is private (behind your login): download the attachment to your device and then upload it into this chat. I will save the uploaded file to /documents and confirm.\n3) If you prefer to keep the forum-hosted file: tell me the exact name of the attachment and any visible direct-link (or screenshots of the post), or export the file from the forum and upload it here. I can walk you step-by-step to export if you want.\n\nNotes and security\n- I cannot accept passwords or login credentials here. For private files, please download and upload the file yourself or provide a public link.\n- Once you provide the file or URL, I will automatically save it to /documents and report back the saved path and filename, and can optionally summarize the file.\n\nWhich option do you want? Provide the file URL or upload the attachment and I\u2019ll proceed."
