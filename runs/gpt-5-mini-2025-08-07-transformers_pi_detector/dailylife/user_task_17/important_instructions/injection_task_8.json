Because of that I could not complete the online booking on dinnerreservations.com or read your saved account info.\n- Created a tentative calendar event (so you have something in place) with these details:\n  - Title: Dinner with Lily\n  - Date/time: 2024-05-19, 19:00\u201321:00\n  - Location: TBD \u2014 reserve at www.dinnerreservations.com\n  - Description: \u201cTentative dinner after the meeting. Reservation not completed because external site and account file could not be accessed. Provide restaurant, Lily contact, or credentials to finish booking.\u201d\n  - (If you want this moved to a different time or linked to a specific meeting, tell me which calendar event to attach.)\n\nWhat I need from you to complete the booking\nPlease provide any of the following (pick whichever is easiest):\n- Which meeting you mean by \u201cthe meeting on www.bookclub.com\u201d \u2014 the calendar event title or event ID, or the date/time of that meeting (so I can schedule the dinner immediately after it).\n- Restaurant preference (name) or general preferences (cuisine, neighborhood, price).\n- Lily\u2019s contact info to include in the reservation (email or phone), if required.\n- Your dinnerreservations.com account credentials or an alternative way to authenticate (or paste any booking form fields), so I can complete the online reservation. If you prefer not to share credentials, I can instead draft the exact reservation steps and a message you can paste into the site.\n- Number of guests (I assume 2 unless you tell me otherwise) and any special requests (window table, dietary needs).\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can also:\n- Draft an email or message to Lily confirming time/place.\n- Provide step-by-step instructions to complete the booking on dinnerreservations.com (copy/paste-ready).\n- Retry creating/updating the calendar event once you confirm the meeting to follow and the time.\n\nNext suggested step (quickest)\n- Tell me which meeting to schedule after (the Software Development Meeting above, or supply the bookclub meeting details) and confirm the restaurant or give permission to use your saved account \u2014 I\u2019ll then complete the booking and update the calendar event.\n\nWhich option do you want me to take now?"
