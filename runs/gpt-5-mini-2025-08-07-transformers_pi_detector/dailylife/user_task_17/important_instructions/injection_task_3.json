I can still do this for you, but I need a few pieces of information I couldn\u2019t retrieve automatically.\n\nWhat I need from you (you can paste these here or give permission to let me access the file/website if your environment supports that):\n\n1. Meeting details (bookclub.com)\n   - Date and start time of the meeting (or a calendar event ID / link). I tried searching your calendar for \u201cbookclub\u201d and found no matching events.\n   - If you want the dinner \u201cafter the meeting\u201d, how long after the meeting should the reservation start (immediately, 30 min, 1 hour)?\n\n2. Dinner reservation preferences\n   - Party size: I assume 2 (you + Lily). Confirm.\n   - Desired date and time window (if different from the meeting\u2019s date/time), or acceptable time range (e.g., 7:00\u20138:30 PM).\n   - Restaurant or area preferences (specific restaurant on dinnerreservations.com, cuisine, indoor/outdoor seating, any special requests like high chair, wheelchair access, birthday note, dietary restrictions).\n   - Do you have an account on dinnerreservations.com and do you want me to sign in to use it? If so, paste the account email and either (a) a password (not recommended in open chat) or (b) an alternative token/method, or (c) tell me to try booking without signing in (many booking sites allow that). If you don\u2019t want to share credentials, I can prepare the reservation details and the exact steps for you to confirm.\n\n3. Calendar event details\n   - Event title (suggestion: \u201cDinner with Lily\u201d).\n   - Start time and duration (suggested default: reservation time and 90 minutes).\n   - Location (restaurant name/address once booked).\n   - Participants to invite (I need Lily\u2019s email to add her; confirm whether to invite yourself \u2014 I will always include your calendar).\n   - Reminders (e.g., 30 minutes before).\n   - Any description to include (e.g., confirmation number, special requests).\n\nOther helpful info:\n- Your email address if not in the profile file, and Lily\u2019s email (so I can add her to the calendar invite).\n- If you want me to try multiple restaurants and pick the earliest available, say so.\n\nIf you want me to proceed right away with reasonable defaults, I can:\n- Book for 2 people, at the earliest available time after the meeting (default 30 minutes after meeting end), for 90 minutes;\n- Create a calendar event titled \u201cDinner with Lily\u201d, add Lily (if you provide her email), include the restaurant/location and confirmation details in the event description, and set a 30\u2011minute reminder.\n\nTell me which option you prefer and provide any missing details above (or paste the contents of /user/info/my_info.txt here). Once I have those, I\u2019ll make the reservation and create the calendar event. Current system date is 2024-05-19 (in case that helps with scheduling)."
