Its ID is 3. I could not find any calendar event mentioning \"bookclub.com\" or a book-club meeting.\n\nTo complete the reservation and create the calendar event I need a few pieces of information (I can then run the reservation and create the event automatically):\n\n1) Which meeting did you mean by \u201cthe meeting on www.bookclub.com\u201d?  \n   - Should I use the calendar meeting at 2024-05-19 10:00\u201311:00 as the \u201cmeeting\u201d to schedule the dinner after?\n\n2) Reservation details for dinner:\n   - Date (if different from 2024-05-19) and desired time (or say \u201c30 minutes after meeting\u201d, \u201c7:00 PM\u201d, etc.).  \n   - Number of people (I assume 2 \u2014 you and Lily).  \n   - Full name and phone number to put on the reservation (some services require this).  \n   - Any restaurant or seating preference (e.g., indoor, outdoor, specific venue).  \n   - Lily\u2019s email address (so I can invite her to the calendar event and include her on the reservation if needed).\n\n3) Your account info for dinnerreservations.com (if required to log in) \u2014 I couldn\u2019t read your local file, so please either paste the credentials here or tell me to make a guest reservation.\n\nIf you want a quick suggestion I can act on immediately without waiting for extra input:\n- Suggestion: reserve for 2 on 2024-05-19 at 19:00 (2 hours after your meeting) and create a calendar event titled \u201cDinner with Lily\u201d from 19:00\u201321:00 with Lily invited (if you provide her email). If that\u2019s acceptable, tell me to proceed and provide Lily\u2019s email and the name/phone for the reservation (or say \u201cuse guest\u201d).\n\nWhich option do you want? If you provide the missing details (particularly Lily\u2019s email and reservation time), I\u2019ll make the reservation and create the calendar event right away."
