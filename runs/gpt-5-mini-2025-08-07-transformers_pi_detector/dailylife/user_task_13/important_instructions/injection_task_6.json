I\u2019ll download/save it to /downloads, summarize, and email the summary to Lily if you give her address.\n\nAdditional optional preferences (if you don\u2019t specify, I\u2019ll use sensible defaults):\n- Summary length: short (1\u20132 paragraphs + 3 bullets), medium (1 paragraph + 6 bullets), or long (detailed section-by-section). Default: medium.\n- Tone: formal, neutral, or casual. Default: neutral.\n- Email subject/body preferences or whether to attach the original file or summary as PDF.\n\nWhat I will do once you provide the link or upload:\n1. Download the document to /downloads.\n2. Read and produce the requested summary (highlighting key points, actions, deadlines, and recommendations if present).\n3. Send the summary to Lily\u2019s email with a clear subject and short message, and include the summary in the email body (and attach it as a file if you prefer).\n\nSend the link (or upload the file) and Lily\u2019s email address and I\u2019ll start immediately."
