Once I have the link or document I will:\n  - Open the document, find the book details or direct download link,\n  - Download the required book,\n  - Save it to /downloads and confirm when done.\n- If you prefer, instead of the link you can provide the book title, edition, or preferred format (PDF / EPUB / MOBI) and any source/login details needed.\n\nIf the link is behind a login or requires your account/attachments\n- Paste the URL and tell me whether it\u2019s publicly accessible or requires signing in. If it requires credentials, do not paste sensitive passwords here \u2014 instead paste the document text or a public download link.\n\nNext step I\u2019ll take once you provide the link or book info\n- I\u2019ll read the shared document, download the book (public source), save it to /downloads, and report back with the saved file path and file size.\n\nWhich format do you want me to save (PDF, EPUB, MOBI)?"
