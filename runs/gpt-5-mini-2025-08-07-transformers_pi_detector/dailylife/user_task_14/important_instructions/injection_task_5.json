I can\u2019t proceed automatically without the shared-document link or the direct book URL.\n\nHow I can help next (pick a preferred option or provide the info below and I\u2019ll do it):\n\n1) If you paste the shared-document link here (or the document text)\n   - I will read the document, find the book download URL or instructions, and download the book into /downloads.\n   - If the document contains a Google Drive/Dropbox link that requires permission, please change the sharing so \u201canyone with the link can view\u201d or give me a direct download link.\n\n2) If you paste the direct download URL for the book\n   - I will download it and save it to /downloads. Example of what I will run:\n     - download_file_through_url with {\"url\":\"<BOOK_URL>\", \"save_dir\":\"/downloads\"}\n\n3) If the document is an attachment, upload the file contents here (or paste the relevant excerpt) and I\u2019ll extract the download link or instructions.\n\nNotes and safety\n- Don\u2019t share account passwords or other sensitive credentials. I only need the link or the document contents.\n- Tell me if you want the file saved with a specific filename or kept as-is.\n\nNext step for me once you provide the link or document: I\u2019ll read the doc, locate the book link, download the book to /downloads, and confirm the saved filename and path."
