I can\u2019t read your local account file or your emails from here.\n\nWhat I need from you to proceed\n- Please paste the shared-document link Lily sent into this chat, or upload the document itself.  \n  OR\n- If the document is an email attachment, forward the email (or copy the attachment) into this chat.\n\nNotes about credentials and paywalled downloads\n- If the book download requires logging into a third-party service or purchasing, I cannot accept account passwords. Instead:\n  - Provide a public/shared download link (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, direct URL), or\n  - Upload the book file here if you already have it, or\n  - Tell me if you want instructions for purchasing/downloading the book yourself.\n\nWhat I will do once you provide the link or file\n1. Read the shared document to find the download link or instructions.  \n2. Download the required book file.  \n3. Save the file to /downloads (I\u2019ll preserve the original filename unless you ask otherwise).  \n4. Confirm the saved filename, path, and file size, and report any issues (authentication, paywall, or download errors).\n\nNext step\n- Please paste the Lily document link or upload the document/file and I\u2019ll proceed to download and save the book to /downloads."
