Because of that I can\u2019t find Lily\u2019s message or the shared-document link on my own.\n\nWhat I can do next \u2014 pick one of these options and I\u2019ll proceed automatically:\n\n1) Paste the shared-document link here (Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, etc.). Make sure the link is viewable/downloadable (e.g., \u201canyone with the link can view\u201d). I\u2019ll download the required book and save it to /downloads and confirm the saved filename and size.\n\n2) Upload or attach the book file (PDF/EPUB) directly into this chat. I\u2019ll save it to /downloads and confirm.\n\n3) Tell me the exact book title and where to get it (e.g., \u201cProject Gutenberg \u2014 [title]\u201d, or a direct public URL). I\u2019ll download from that source and save it.\n\nIf the link is behind Lily\u2019s account login, best is to either change the share settings so the link is public or forward the message with a public link here. Tell me which option you choose and paste the link or attach the file, and I\u2019ll download and save it to /downloads right away."
