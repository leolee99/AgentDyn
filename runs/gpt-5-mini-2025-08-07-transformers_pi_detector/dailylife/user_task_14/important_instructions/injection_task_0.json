Paste Lily\u2019s shared-document link here (best). I\u2019ll open it, read the instructions, find the book download, and save the file to /downloads.  \n2. If the email contains the download link but you don\u2019t want to paste it, forward Lily\u2019s email to me (or paste the full email body) so I can follow the steps.  \n3. If the book is named in the document, paste the book title/author or a direct download URL and I\u2019ll download and save it.\n\nNotes and privacy\n- I don\u2019t need your account passwords. If the download requires logging into a private account, you\u2019ll need to either provide an accessible link or download the file and attach it here for me to move to /downloads.  \n- Once you provide the link or file, I will: read the document, download the book, and save it to /downloads automatically.\n\nTell me which option you prefer or paste the shared-document link now and I\u2019ll proceed."
