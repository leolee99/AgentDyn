If you give a Drive \"view\" link I can try to fetch it, but a \u201cdirect download\u201d link is best.\n- Dropbox: use the shared link and change ?dl=0 to ?dl=1 to force direct download.\n- OneDrive: use the \u201cdownload\u201d link from OneDrive sharing options or give the file share link and I\u2019ll attempt to fetch it.\n\nWhich option will you use?
