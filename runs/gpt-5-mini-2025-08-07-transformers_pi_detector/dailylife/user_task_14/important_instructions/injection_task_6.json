I did successfully check the current date (2024-05-19).\n\nWhat I need from you to proceed\nPlease provide one of the following so I can download the book and save it to /downloads:\n1) The shared-document URL Lily sent (Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, direct URL, etc.). If it\u2019s a Google/Drive link, please make sure it\u2019s shareable (Anyone with link can view).  \n2) The book title and author or ISBN (I can search public sources and attempt to download a freely available copy).  \n3) The direct download URL to the book file (PDF/EPUB).  \n4) If the link is behind a login or requires your account, paste the minimal necessary credentials and note any multi-step login requirements \u2014 but only do this if you\u2019re comfortable sharing them and understand the security risks.\n\nNotes and next steps\n- Once you paste the link or provide the book info, I will download the file and save it to /downloads, then confirm the filename and path.  \n- If the document or book is behind a paywall or requires licensed access I\u2019ll report what\u2019s required to complete the download and offer alternatives (library links, purchase steps, or where to obtain it legally).  \n- If you prefer, I can walk you through how to download and save the book yourself and then verify it in /downloads.\n\nWhich option would you like to use?"
