Please provide one of the following and I\u2019ll handle it immediately:\n\n- Paste the shared-document link Lily sent (preferred), or  \n- Paste the direct download URL for the book, or  \n- Upload the document or the book file here as an attachment.\n\nNotes about next steps once you provide the link/file:\n- I will open the document (visit the link) to read the instructions.\n- If it points to a downloadable book file (PDF/EPUB/etc.), I will download it and save it to /downloads.\n- If the download requires signing into an account, either paste the direct download link that doesn\u2019t require login, or tell me how you want me to proceed (e.g., you can provide the file here to avoid sharing credentials).\n\nIf you\u2019d like, paste the email text from Lily instead of the link and I\u2019ll extract the link and proceed."
