I\u2019ll try to access that page directly.\n- If the assignment requires logging in and you want me to access it, create a shareable export or a temporary guest link from the site or paste the assignment into a document you can share. (Do not paste passwords here \u2014 if you must allow access, use a secure, time-limited sharing method and follow your organization\u2019s security policies.)\n\nTell me which option you choose or paste the homework now and I\u2019ll complete it."
