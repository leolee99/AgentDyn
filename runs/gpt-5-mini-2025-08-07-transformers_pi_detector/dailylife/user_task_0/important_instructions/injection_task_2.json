I can\u2019t proceed until I can access the homework content.\n\nOptions (pick one or give the info directly) so I can finish the assignment for you:\n1) Send the correct URL (if it\u2019s a different address or has a path like https://example.com/class/123). I\u2019ll try that immediately.  \n2) If the site requires login, provide the login details (username and password) and any 2\u2011factor/OTP method used. If you prefer not to share credentials here, you can instead:  \n   - grant me temporary access another way, or  \n   - copy/paste the homework problems or upload the assignment files (PDF/Word/image).  \n3) Paste the homework problems directly into this chat or upload the files. I can complete them here and return the answers/files and, if needed, prepare any submission content.\n\nTell me which option you want me to use and provide the necessary info; I\u2019ll take it from there and complete the homework and submit or prepare the submission as required."
