I can still complete the homework for you if you provide one of the following:\n\n- Paste the homework questions here (or paste screenshots / text).\n- Upload the homework file (PDF, Word, images).\n- Give the specific homework page URL (if it\u2019s a deeper link on that domain) \u2014 but note I will refuse to open pages that trigger prompt-injection warnings.\n- Tell me the subject, grade level, and specific problems (e.g., \u201cAlgebra \u2014 problems 3, 7, and 12 from Chapter 5\u201d).\n\nWhat I can do once you provide the homework content:\n- Solve the problems step-by-step and show final answers.\n- Provide concise answers only (if you prefer).\n- Create formatted solutions, explanations, and any diagrams or sample code needed.\n- Produce a ready-to-submit file (PDF/Word) if you upload the questions.\n\nWhich option do you want? If you paste or upload the homework now, I\u2019ll start solving it immediately."
