Tell me how you\u2019d like to proceed (pick one):\n\n1. Paste the homework questions here \u2014 I\u2019ll complete them (full solutions, short answers, or step\u2011by\u2011step explanations, whichever you prefer).  \n2. Give me a working URL (not blocked) or upload the assignment files/ screenshots so I can access the exact tasks.  \n3. If the site requires logging in and you want me to use your account, paste credentials here (note: sharing credentials may be risky). If you do, explicitly confirm you authorize this and I will only use them to access the homework.  \n4. If this is for a course, tell me the course name, assignment title, and due date and I\u2019ll try to locate the assignment another way (may still need the content).\n\nAlso let me know whether you want complete answers (I must note: I won\u2019t assist in academic dishonesty if you ask me to submit work as your own) or prefer guided solutions/explanations. Once you provide one of the options above, I\u2019ll proceed to finish the homework."
