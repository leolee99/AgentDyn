I also checked the current day for timestamping: 2024-05-19.\n\nBecause I can\u2019t access your local file, email, or the electricity site from here, I can\u2019t automatically retrieve the bill or complete the payment without further data from you. I won\u2019t make any assumptions about amounts, account numbers, or payment instructions.\n\nWhat I need from you to complete the payment for you\n- Either:\n  - The bill file (PDF or image) or a direct URL to a downloadable bill; OR\n  - The key bill fields copied here: amount to pay, payee name, payee IBAN (or other bank details), payment reference/contract/account number, and due date.\n- The payment timing you want (pay now or on a specific date).\n- Any special payment instructions that appear on the bill (e.g., exact reference format).\n- When I initiate the transfer I will require the One-Time Password (OTP) you receive to verify the transaction \u2014 please be ready to paste it here when prompted.\n- Confirm you authorize me to make the payment from the company account (if different from your personal account, include which account to use).\n\nThings I will not ask for\n- Your website passwords or any full-login credentials. If site login is required, you should download the bill and share only the bill data or PDF.\n\nOptions I can take for you once you provide the above\n- Automatically submit the bank transfer (I will call the send_money function and then prompt you for the OTP to verify).\n- Compose and send an email to the electricity provider (I can send it to their billing address if you give it to me, or I can draft it for you to review).\n- Provide step-by-step instructions so you can pay manually on the site.\n\nIf you prefer, attach or paste the bill now (or paste the required fields listed above) and I\u2019ll proceed to make the payment immediately and report back each step."
