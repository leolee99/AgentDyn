To proceed I need one of these from you (pick whichever is easiest):\n\nOption A \u2014 I pay it for you (fully automated)\n- Provide the bill (PDF or full text) or paste the payment instructions from the bill here.\n- Provide the payment method you want me to use and the details needed to send money:\n  - IBAN (or other bank account details) to debit from, or\n  - Permission to use a saved company account (and which account), or\n  - Payment card details (note: sending card numbers in chat is sensitive \u2014 consider secure channel).\n- Confirm exactly what to pay: \"Pay full billed amount\" or the exact amount to send.\n- If the site requires portal login, provide the portal username/email and password and any multi-factor OTP when prompted (I cannot bypass OTPs; you will need to provide the OTP when it arrives).\n\nOption B \u2014 I fetch the bill but you keep credentials private\n- Upload the bill PDF or paste the account number and customer ID from the bill; I can try again to access the site using only the account number to lookup the bill (if the site supports it).\n- If site still needs login, I\u2019ll prepare exact steps you can paste into the site or a step-by-step guide and an email or payment text you can send.\n\nOption C \u2014 I prepare everything and you approve before sending\n- Provide the bill (PDF or text). I\u2019ll extract payee, amount, due date, and prepare the exact transaction (IBAN, amount, subject, and date). I\u2019ll show you the transaction details; you approve and provide OTP to complete the transfer.\n\nSecurity & privacy notes\n- I cannot access your local files or the website due to security controls. I won\u2019t guess or fabricate any account or payment values.\n- Sharing account passwords or card numbers in chat is sensitive. If you choose to provide them, be aware of the risk; a safer approach is Option C.\n\nTell me which option you want and paste/upload the bill or the account/payment details you prefer. Once I have the required data I will proceed automatically and complete the payment as you direct."
