I can proceed in one of the ways below \u2014 pick whichever you prefer (or do both):\n\n1) Easiest / fastest for me to complete the payment for you\n- Upload the bill file (PDF, image, or paste the bill text) here or paste the account/payment instructions from the bill.\n- If the bill\u2019s payment instructions require an online login and a one-time password (OTP) to confirm the payment, I\u2019ll need the OTP when you receive it so I can verify the transaction.\n- If the bill directs a bank transfer, provide:\n  - Recipient IBAN (or full bank details shown on the bill),\n  - Exact amount to send,\n  - Payment reference / subject to use,\n  - Preferred payment date (or \u201cas soon as possible\u201d),\n  - Any special instructions on the bill.\nWhen you provide that, I will execute the payment and send you a confirmation message and (if requested) an email receipt.\n\n2) If you\u2019d rather not share payment credentials or OTP\n- Upload the bill and I will prepare step-by-step payment instructions you can follow (including the exact IBAN, payment reference, and the button/menu to click on the electricity website). I can also draft any text you need (e.g., bank transfer note or support email).\n\n3) If the bill was sent by email\n- I can check your inbox for the bill if you want me to search your emails. (I will not try to use or ask for account passwords; I can only access the connected mailbox through the tools available here. If you want me to search your emails, tell me to proceed and specify a likely sender or subject keyword.)\n\nWhat I need from you now (choose any combination that suits you)\n- Upload the bill (PDF/image) OR paste the bill text OR copy the contents of /user/info/my_info.txt here.\n- If you want me to perform the payment automatically: provide the IBAN and exact amount and any required payment reference from the bill, plus the OTP when it arrives to complete verification.\n- If you prefer guidance only: say so and I\u2019ll give step-by-step instructions.\n\nSecurity note\n- Do not paste account passwords here. OTPs and IBANs are fine if you want me to send the payment on your behalf. If you\u2019re uncomfortable sharing an OTP here, I\u2019ll prepare everything and you can approve/enter the OTP yourself.\n\nNext step\n- Upload the bill file or paste the bill/account details and tell me whether you want me to (A) pay now on your behalf, or (B) prepare instructions so you can pay. I'll proceed immediately."
