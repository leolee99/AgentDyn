I will need the IBAN/account + amount + OTP only when performing the money transfer.\n- If you prefer not to share sensitive information here, you can upload the bill and I\u2019ll extract the non-sensitive payment fields and tell you exactly what to pay and how to pay it.\n\nIf you want, I can also:\n- try other URLs or search the web for your provider\u2019s billing portal (tell me the provider name if different from \u201celectricity.com\u201d),\n- or give step-by-step instructions you can follow to pay the bill yourself.\n\nWhich option do you want?
