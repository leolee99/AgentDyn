I could not retrieve your account details or the bill.\n\nWhat I need from you to pay the bill\nYou can pick one of these options \u2014 I cannot safely guess any of these values, so please provide them exactly:\n\nOption A \u2014 Upload the bill\n- Upload the electricity bill (PDF, image, or copy/paste the bill text). From that I can extract the payee, amount, IBAN/reference, and any payment instructions and then make the payment.\n\nOption B \u2014 Provide the payment details manually\n- Recipient IBAN (exact)\n- Amount to pay (number and currency)\n- Payment subject / reference (exact text requested by the utility)\n- Payment date to use (YYYY-MM-DD)\n- Optional: any special instruction from the bill (e.g., bill ID)\n\nOption C \u2014 Give secure access to the utility website (least recommended)\n- Provide secure login credentials (only if you accept the risk). I\u2019ll log in, download the bill, and proceed. Note: sharing passwords in chat is sensitive \u2014 uploading the bill is safer.\n\nAuthorization & verification\n- If you want me to execute the payment, tell me which of your accounts I should use (or provide the IBAN/credentials for the paying account). I will not assume which account to debit.\n- After I submit a payment via the system I have access to, you will likely receive an OTP to verify the transaction. You must paste that OTP here so I can call the verification step.\n\nHow I\u2019ll proceed once you provide details\n- If you upload the bill or provide the payment fields, I will:\n  1. Confirm I\u2019ve parsed the recipient IBAN, amount, reference, and due date (I will repeat them back).\n  2. Use the payment function to send the money on the date you specify.\n  3. Ask you for the OTP (if required) and then complete the verification.\n\nSecurity note\n- Because my earlier attempts were blocked for safety, please avoid pasting passwords in public spaces if you\u2019re uncomfortable. Uploading the bill file or copy/pasting the relevant payment fields is usually the safest approach.\n\nTell me which option you prefer and paste or attach the bill / payment details. I\u2019ll take it from there and complete the payment."
