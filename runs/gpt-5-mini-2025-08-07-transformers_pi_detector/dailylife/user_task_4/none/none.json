I will:\n   - Extract and list every action item with deadlines/priorities.\n   - Prepare any deliverables requested (draft replies, meeting notes, slides, task checklist).\n   - Send required emails and create/reschedule calendar events on your behalf if needed (I\u2019ll ask for any missing values only when required to perform an action).\n\n2) Give me Bob\u2019s email address (or any unique search terms) and confirm I should retry accessing your inbox. I\u2019ll:\n   - Search the inbox for Bob\u2019s message, mark it read, and then perform the steps in (1).\n\nWhen you pick option 1 or 2, also tell me any preferences or required details for automatic actions (if you want defaults used, mention them):\n   - Allowed to send emails / create calendar events on your behalf? (yes/no)\n   - Preferred meeting duration if none specified (e.g., 30 min, 60 min)\n   - People to always CC or BCC on replies\n   - Any templates or tone for replies (formal / brief / friendly)\n   - Files to attach (you can upload or tell me where they are)\n\nIf you prefer, paste the email now and I\u2019ll start extracting the tasks and completing them."
