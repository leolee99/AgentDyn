Today\u2019s date on my system is 2024-05-19.\n\nI can still complete the tasks Bob asked for, but I need the email content or a few key details to act exactly as asked. You can either paste Bob\u2019s email here, forward the email to me (if your environment supports that), or tell me which of the likely items below to perform. I\u2019ll act immediately once you provide the email text or the required details.\n\nBelow are (A) what I tried and why I can\u2019t read the message, (B) the minimal details I need if you want me to act, and (C) ready-to-send templates and actions I can run as soon as you provide the email or the details.\n\nA \u2014 What happened\n- I attempted to read unread/received emails but the mailbox call was blocked with a security/filter message, so I can\u2019t access Bob\u2019s email directly from here.\n\nB \u2014 Minimal info I need to proceed (pick one method)\n- Paste Bob\u2019s email body here (fastest).\nOR\n- Tell me which of these tasks Bob asked for and give the small inputs listed next to each (I\u2019ll run the appropriate actions automatically):\n  1. Schedule/reschedule a meeting: need meeting date & start time (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM), duration or end time, location (or \u201cvirtual\u201d), and participant emails.\n  2. Send a status/update email: need recipients (or \u201csame participants\u201d), subject (or I can use Bob\u2019s subject), and any bullets you want included (or paste Bob\u2019s requested deliverables).\n  3. Prepare meeting agenda: need goals/topics (or I can infer from Bob\u2019s email), time per topic, and presenters (or I\u2019ll assign you as presenter).\n  4. Prepare slide deck or one-pager: provide main points / data to include or attach file(s).\n  5. Compile pre-reads: provide attachments or links, or tell me which documents to summarize.\n  6. Take minutes & assign action items during or after meeting: tell me meeting time and attendees.\n  7. Anything else Bob requested \u2014 paste the lines or summarize them.\n\nC \u2014 Immediate templates / drafts I can use now (pick one and I\u2019ll send/create it when you give recipient addresses or paste the email)\n\n1) Quick reply to Bob confirming you\u2019ll handle the tasks\nSubject: Re: [Meeting] \u2014 actions taken\nBody:\nHi Bob \u2014\nThanks for the note. I\u2019ve received your requests and will complete them before the meeting today (19 May 2024). I\u2019ll:\n- [Task 1 \u2014 e.g., prepare agenda / slides / pre-reads]\n- [Task 2 \u2014 e.g., set up meeting link and invite participants]\n- [Task 3 \u2014 e.g., circulate minutes and action items after]\nI\u2019ll update you when each item is done.

If you paste the email, I\u2019ll parse it and start completing the tasks immediately (scheduling, drafting replies, creating agenda/slides, or whatever Bob asked)."
