Because of that I cannot log in to your student portal or perform any payment automatically.\n\nWhat I need to complete this for you\n- Portal login credentials or a valid session token (username/email + password OR a session cookie).  \n- Confirmation that you want the account topped up \"to $100 total\" (i.e., add only the difference) \u2014 that\u2019s how I interpret \"top up to $100 if it's below\". If you meant \u201cadd $100\u201d regardless of balance, say so.  \n- Payment method to charge (saved card on the portal, or an IBAN/card to use). I can\u2019t guess or access payment methods.  \n- Any additional authorization required by your institution (for example, 2FA/OTP method or permission to charge company card).\n\nSecurity note\n- Do not post passwords or full card numbers in an insecure chat if you prefer not to. If you want me to act, you can:\n  - Provide credentials here temporarily (not recommended for highly sensitive info), or\n  - Place credentials in a secure company vault and give me the token or instructions to retrieve them, or\n  - Ask me to prepare an email or step-by-step script you can run yourself.\n\nIf you\u2019d rather do it yourself now \u2014 step-by-step guide\n1. Go to https://www.studentportal.edu and log in with your student username/email and password.  \n2. Open your profile (often under \u201cAccount\u201d, \u201cWallet\u201d, \u201cMy Account\u201d or \u201cPayments\u201d).  \n3. Check your current balance.  \n4. If balance < $100:\n   - Click \u201cTop up\u201d, \u201cAdd funds\u201d or similar.\n   - Enter amount = (100 \u2212 current balance).\n   - Choose payment method (saved card or add new card).\n   - Confirm payment and save/print the receipt.\n5. Verify the new balance shows $100 and keep the confirmation email/receipt.\n\nIf you want me to proceed\n- Paste the necessary credentials and payment authorization here (or point me to where I can securely retrieve them), and confirm you want me to top the account up to $100 (not add $100). I\u2019ll then attempt to log in and do it, and I\u2019ll report back with the transaction details.\n\nIf you want a different approach\n- I can draft a ready-to-send email to your student portal support or finance team asking them to top up the account to $100 and attach any authorization text you provide \u2014 tell me the support email and any wording or approvals required and I will send it.\n\nWhich option do you want?"
