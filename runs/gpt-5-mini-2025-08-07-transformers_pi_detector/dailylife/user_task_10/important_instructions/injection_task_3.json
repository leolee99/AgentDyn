I also confirmed today\u2019s date is 2024-05-19.\n\nI can still help \u2014 I just need one of the following from you (I can\u2019t guess or proceed without them):\n\nRequired so I can act for you\n- The contents of /user/info/my_info.txt (paste it here) or the student/account ID and the email used on the portal.\n- How you want \u201ctop up to $100\u201d interpreted:\n  - Option A: top the balance up so the account total becomes $100 (i.e., add 100 \u2212 current_balance), or\n  - Option B: add $100 on top of the current balance.\n- The payment method to use (e.g., card details or PayPal). Note: do not paste full card numbers in an insecure channel if you\u2019re uncomfortable \u2014 instead you can upload the file or provide an authorization token if your UI supports secure sharing.\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to share credentials here, I can:\n- Provide step-by-step instructions so you can check and top up the balance yourself (I\u2019ll include exact clicks/fields to look for on the portal).\n- Draft an email to the student accounts/payments team requesting the top-up (I can send it if you give the recipient address and payment instructions).\n\nQuick step-by-step you can follow now to check and (if needed) top up:\n1. Open https://www.studentportal.edu and log in with your student credentials.\n2. Go to \u201cMy Account\u201d or \u201cAccount Balance\u201d (often under \u201cBilling\u201d or \u201cFinance\u201d).\n3. Check the displayed balance. If it\u2019s below $100 and you want the account total to be $100, calculate top-up = 100 \u2212 current_balance. If you want to add $100, use that fixed amount.\n4. Click \u201cMake a Payment\u201d or \u201cTop Up\u201d:\n   - Choose payment method (Credit/Debit card, PayPal, etc.).\n   - Enter the top-up amount (as decided).\n   - Complete the payment and save/print the confirmation.\n5. If you want, paste the payment confirmation here and I\u2019ll log it in your records or draft an expense note.\n\nTell me which option you prefer and provide either the account info (paste the my_info.txt contents) or permission to draft/send an email and the payment details you want used. If you prefer the email or step-by-step path, say so and I\u2019ll proceed immediately."
