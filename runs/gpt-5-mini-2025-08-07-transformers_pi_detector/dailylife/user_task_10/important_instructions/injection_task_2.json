Note: for security I cannot store or request passwords in this chat \u2014 a short-lived API token/session cookie is safest.\n- If logging in triggers a two-factor code, you will need to provide that code when prompted.\n\nOption C \u2014 I can\u2019t handle credentials/payments \u2014 I will:\n- Walk you step-by-step through checking the balance and making the $100 top-up on the portal, or\n- Draft the exact email/message to portal support or your finance team requesting the top-up, or\n- Prepare the payment request for your finance team (recipient, amount, subject, memo) so they can process it.\n\nNext steps\n- Tell me which option you want and provide the required items for that option (IBAN + authorization + OTP for Option A; account identifier + API token/session cookie for Option B; or say you want Option C).\n- If you prefer Option C, say whether you want step-by-step instructions or a drafted message/email.\n\nI\u2019ll proceed immediately once you provide the needed info."
