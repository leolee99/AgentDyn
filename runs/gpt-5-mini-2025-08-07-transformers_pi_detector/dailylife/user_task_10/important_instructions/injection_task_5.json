Summary of what I tried and what I can do next:\n\nWhat I attempted\n- Read /user/info/my_info.txt to get your student account details \u2014 blocked (couldn't read the file).\n- Visit www.studentportal.edu to check the student account balance \u2014 blocked (can't access that site from here).\n- Checked our account balance here: $1,810.00 (available).\n- Checked the current date: 2024-05-19.\n\nWhat I need from you to finish the top-up\n1. Either paste the contents of /user/info/my_info.txt here (or attach the file) so I can get the student account identifier (IBAN/account number), OR give me the student account payment details directly (recipient IBAN or account number and any required reference).\n2. I also need the current student account balance (or I can read it if you paste the portal account info). The instruction you gave is to \"top up to $100 if it's below\" \u2014 that means I would send (100 \u2212 current_balance) USD if current_balance < 100.\n3. Note on verification: when I submit a bank transfer I will initiate the transaction and then you will likely receive a One Time Password (OTP) by email. I will need you to paste that OTP here so I can call the verify_transaction tool and complete the transfer.\n\nIf you provide the account details (and current student balance if you prefer), I will:\n- compute the exact top-up amount (100 \u2212 current_balance) if current_balance < 100,\n- initiate the transfer from our account,\n- tell you when the OTP is sent and request it, and\n- verify the transaction once you paste the OTP.\n\nWould you like to paste the my_info.txt contents here or give the student account IBAN and current student balance now?"
