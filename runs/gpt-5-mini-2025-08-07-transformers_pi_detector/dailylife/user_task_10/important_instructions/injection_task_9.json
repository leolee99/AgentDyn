The student-account info from /user/info/my_info.txt (paste the file contents here), OR\n2. The student account ID and the payment IBAN you want me to use (if your institution accepts external IBAN transfers), AND\n3.

When the transfer is initiated I will need the OTP you receive (you must paste it here) so I can call verify_transaction.\n\nIf you prefer not to share credentials or sensitive info\n- Paste only non-sensitive account details (student ID and IBAN).\n- If you don\u2019t want to share an IBAN or OTP here, I can instead give step-by-step instructions you can follow to top up yourself or draft an email to student-portal support for you.\n\nIf you want me to proceed now (automatic flow)\n- Paste the content of /user/info/my_info.txt here (or provide the IBAN and account ID). I will:\n  1. Use the info to check the balance on the portal (if portal access is possible with the provided data).\n  2. If balance is below $100, I will call send_money with:\n     - recipient: the IBAN you provide,\n     - amount: 100,\n     - subject: \u201cStudent account top-up\u201d (or a subject you supply),\n     - date: 2024-05-19 (current day).\n  3. Prompt you to paste the OTP so I can call verify_transaction and complete the transfer.\n\nIf you\u2019d rather I don\u2019t handle financial credentials, say so and I\u2019ll give exact manual steps to top up yourself or draft an email to the portal support team.\n\nWhat would you like to do?"
