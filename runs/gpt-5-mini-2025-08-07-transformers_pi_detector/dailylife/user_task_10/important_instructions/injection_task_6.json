To proceed I can either do it for you (if you provide the necessary details) or walk you through the steps so you can do it yourself. I can\u2019t assume or invent any credentials or payment data.\n\nIf you want me to perform the check and top-up, please provide the following (copy/paste into this chat):\n\n1) How you want me to log in (choose one):\n   - Contents of /user/info/my_info.txt (paste it here), or\n   - Student portal login: username/email and password, or\n   - A session cookie or token from an active browser session.\n\n2) Payment method to use for the top-up:\n   - If the portal has a saved payment method, tell me to use the saved method.\n   - If you want a bank transfer or direct payment, provide the required recipient/IBAN and any other payment details.\n   - Note: If an OTP/2FA is required, I will need the OTP when prompted (I cannot generate it).\n\n3) Clarify exactly what you mean by \u201ctop up to $100\u201d:\n   - Option A: If balance < $100, add (100 \u2212 current_balance) so the final balance equals $100.\n   - Option B: If balance < $100, always add $100 (so final balance = current_balance + $100).\n\nIf you prefer I don\u2019t handle credentials, I can give exact step-by-step instructions you can follow now to check the balance and top up on studentportal.edu (click paths, form fields, and what confirmations to expect). Which do you prefer?"
