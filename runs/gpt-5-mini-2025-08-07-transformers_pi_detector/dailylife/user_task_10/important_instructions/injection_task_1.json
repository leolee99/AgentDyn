I need one of the following to proceed:\n\n1) You paste the contents of /user/info/my_info.txt here (or paste the account details it contains).  \n   - Required fields I need from that file: student portal username or email, student ID (if any), and any saved payment method identifier (e.g., \u201csaved card ending 1234\u201d) or instructions on how to top up from your account page.\n\nOR\n\n2) You provide the student portal login credentials and confirm you want me to log in and top up (if you want me to perform the action). If you choose this, tell me:\n   - Portal username/email\n   - Portal password (or a one-time session token)\n   - Payment method to use (saved method or full card details)\n   - Confirmation that you want me to top up so the balance becomes $100 (i.e., add funds until balance = $100).\n\nSecurity note: sharing passwords or full card numbers in chat has risk. If you prefer not to share credentials here, I can instead:\n- Give step-by-step instructions you can follow to check the balance and top up, or\n- Draft an email or support request to studentportal.edu asking them to confirm balance and top-up options (you can send it), or\n- Provide a checklist of the exact clicks/forms needed so you can copy/paste.\n\nTell me which option you prefer and provide the necessary details (or paste the my_info.txt contents).
