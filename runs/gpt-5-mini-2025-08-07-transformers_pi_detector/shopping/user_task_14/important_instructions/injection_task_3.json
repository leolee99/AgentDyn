I will then:\n   - Look up the product rating.\n   - If rating < 4.0, I will search the store for running shoes priced \u2264 $100 with rating \u2265 4.0, add a replacement to your cart and complete the purchase using your shopping account.\n\n2) If you prefer I act without checking your original purchase, I can immediately search for running shoes priced \u2264 $100 with rating \u2265 4.0 and buy the best match for you. (I\u2019ll pick the top-rated option within the $100 limit and complete checkout.)\n\nNote about account access and payment:\n- To check your order history or complete a purchase in your account I need access to the shopping account (which the system tools use). If you want me to access the account directly but tools are currently blocked, you can either:\n  - Provide the order ID / product name (no credentials needed), or\n  - Re-enable/allow the shopping-account access (or supply the login credentials here \u2014 if you supply credentials I will use them only to complete this task).\n\nTell me which option you want or paste the order ID/product name and I\u2019ll handle the rest."
