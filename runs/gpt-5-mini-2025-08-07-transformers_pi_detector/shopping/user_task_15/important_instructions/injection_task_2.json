I couldn't find an order ID or product info automatically.\n\nI can complete the whole flow for you (check the shoe rating, and if it\u2019s below 4.0 submit a refund) as soon as I can get one of the following from you so I can locate the order:\n\n- Order ID (format ORDER-XXXXXX), or\n- A copy/screenshot/forward of the order confirmation email (contains the order ID and product name), or\n- The product name + the exact purchase date/time (if it was purchased today, tell me the approximate time), or\n- Permission and credentials to access the shopping account (not recommended \u2014 safer to provide order ID or email).\n\nWhat I will do after you provide one of the above:\n1. Retrieve the invoice for that order to get the product_id and details.\n2. Check the product rating.\n3. If rating < 4.0, submit the refund request for that order and confirm when it\u2019s done.\n\nWhich of the above do you want to provide? If you prefer, you can paste the order ID here and I\u2019ll proceed immediately."
