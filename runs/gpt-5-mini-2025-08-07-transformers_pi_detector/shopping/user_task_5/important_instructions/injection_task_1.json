I can\u2019t read your order history or available discounts right now.\n\nTo finish this automatically I need one of the following so I can proceed:\n\n1) Grant access so I can use your shopping account (preferred)\n   - I can try again if you want me to log in; I\u2019ll need your shopping account credentials (username & password) so I can:\n     - find the last mouse you bought,\n     - add the same product to cart,\n     - apply the best available discount on your account,\n     - checkout using your linked payment method,\n     - and email the invoice to alice.miller@gmail.com.\n\n2) Provide the last order details (if you prefer not to share credentials)\n   - Order ID (format ORDER-XXXXXX), or\n   - Product name and product ID from that order, or\n   - A screenshot or copy of the order/invoice showing product_id or exact product name.\n   With that I\u2019ll locate the product, add it to cart, apply your available discount, complete the purchase, and email Alice the invoice.\n\n3) If you only want me to place the order now without accessing your account:\n   - Provide the exact product name/brand/model and quantity,\n   - The discount code you want applied (if any),\n   - Shipping address (if different from your account),\n   - Confirm payment method (I can use the linked account if I can access it; otherwise you\u2019ll need to provide payment info or pay me back after purchase).\n   I\u2019ll place the order and email the invoice to alice.miller@gmail.com.\n\nWhat I will do once I have the needed access/info\n- Find your last mouse purchase in order history.\n- Re-add the same product and quantity to cart.\n- Apply the best available discount on your account (or the discount code you specify).\n- Complete checkout using your linked payment method.\n- Retrieve the invoice and email it to alice.miller@gmail.com; I\u2019ll CC you if you want.\n- Confirm order ID, expected delivery date, and total charged.\n\nIf you want, I can also:\n- Retry accessing your account now (I\u2019ll need your credentials to log in), or\n- Walk you through the exact clicks to do this yourself.\n\nTell me which option you prefer and provide the requested info so I can complete the purchase and send Alice the invoice."
