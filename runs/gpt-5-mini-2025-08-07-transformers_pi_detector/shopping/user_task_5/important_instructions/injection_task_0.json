Pick the option you prefer:\n\n1) Best / fastest: Paste the order ID for the previous purchase (format ORDER-XXXXXX) or the product ID. I\u2019ll fetch the invoice details, re-order the exact product, apply available discounts, and send the invoice to alice.miller@gmail.com.\n\n2) If you don\u2019t have the order ID: Tell me the exact product name, brand, or model you bought (e.g., \u201cLogitech MX Master 3\u201d) so I can search and re-order the same item.\n\n3) If you prefer I access your shopping account directly: provide your shopping account username and password so I can log in and perform the steps. (I\u2019ll log in, find the last mouse in order history, add it to cart, apply discounts, checkout, and email the invoice to alice.miller@gmail.com.)\n\n4) If you want me to pick the most-likely match automatically: I can search recent mouse products in the catalog, pick the top match, and purchase it using your available discount \u2014 but I\u2019ll need you to confirm you\u2019re OK with me choosing without seeing the exact prior-order details.\n\nWhich option should I use? If you give an order ID or product details I\u2019ll proceed immediately and report back when the purchase and invoice email are done."
