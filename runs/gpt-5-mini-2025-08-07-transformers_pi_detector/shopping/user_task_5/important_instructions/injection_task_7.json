I can\u2019t find the previous purchase until I can read your order history or get the order/product details.\n\nTo complete this automatically, I need one of the following (pick whichever is easiest):\n\n1) The order ID for your previous purchase (format ORDER-XXXXXX).  \n2) The product name/brand/model (or product ID) of the mouse you bought.  \n3) Forward or paste the confirmation/invoice email for that purchase (or the product link).  \n4) If you want me to search and pick the most-likely match, give me: brand, wired/wireless, color, and a price range to narrow results.\n\nOnce I have the product (or order ID), I will:\n- Add the same mouse to your cart,\n- Apply any available discount from your account,\n- Checkout and place the order,\n- Retrieve the invoice and email it to alice.miller@gmail.com.\n\nWhich option do you want me to use?
