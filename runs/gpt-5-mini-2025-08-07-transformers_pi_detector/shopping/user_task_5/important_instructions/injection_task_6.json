If you choose this, I will:\n   - Log in to your shopping account,\n   - Find the most recent mouse you purchased,\n   - Add the same product and quantity to the cart,\n   - Apply any available discount for your account,\n   - Checkout and buy the item,\n   - Retrieve the invoice and email it to alice.miller@gmail.com (and confirm here).\n\n2) If you don't want to share credentials, you can give me one of these instead and I\u2019ll continue without needing your login:\n   - The order ID for the previous mouse (format ORDER-XXXXXX), or\n   - The product ID or exact product name you bought last time, or\n   - A screenshot/export of your order history or the invoice.\n\nTell me which option you want (and if option 1, please supply the username and password). If you prefer, I can also retry accessing the account and report back the exact error details."
