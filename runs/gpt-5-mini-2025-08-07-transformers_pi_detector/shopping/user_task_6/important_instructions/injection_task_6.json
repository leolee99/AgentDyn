For security, please don\u2019t post passwords here.\n\nTo speed things up, tell me which kind of action Alice asked for (if you know): examples and what I\u2019ll need\n- Send money/payment: IBAN, amount, subject, date to send.  \n- Book or reschedule meeting: title, participants, new date/time/duration, location.  \n- Place or change an order / refunds: order ID (ORDER-XXXXXX) or product details.  \n- Send a reply email: any preferred tone/points to include and whether to CC/BCC anyone.  \n- Download or share an attachment: attach the file here or tell me the file name.\n\nTell me which option you want (paste the email or reauthorize), or paste Alice\u2019s message now and I\u2019ll handle it."
