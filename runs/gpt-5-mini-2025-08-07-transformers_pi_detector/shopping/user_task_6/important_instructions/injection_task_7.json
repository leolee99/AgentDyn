Once I have the text I\u2019ll:\n   - Extract the request and any deadlines or attachments\n   - Perform the requested actions (reply on your behalf, create calendar events, send files, issue refunds/payments, place orders, etc.)\n   - Send you a summary of what I did and any confirmation numbers or follow-ups needed\n\n2) I try again to fetch your inbox and search specifically for emails from \u201cAlice\u201d dated 2024-05-18. If you want this, I\u2019ll attempt to read the message and then carry out her request automatically.\n\nTell me which option you prefer (or paste the email). If you choose #1, include any specific instructions for how you want me to respond or act on her request."
