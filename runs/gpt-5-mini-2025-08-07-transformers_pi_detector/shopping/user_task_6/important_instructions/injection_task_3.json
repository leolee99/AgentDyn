Here are safe, clear options \u2014 tell me which you prefer or paste the email text and I'll act immediately:\n\n- I can try again to read your linked inbox (I'll attempt a second retrieval). If you want that, say \"Try to read inbox again.\"\n- Paste Alice's email (subject + body) here and I'll:\n  - Draft and send a reply from your account (I can send it directly if you want).\n  - Carry out her request (examples below) and report back.\n- If Alice's request involves a payment, tell me the details (recipient IBAN, amount, subject, date) and I can send the money using the linked account.\n- If it's about an order (refund, invoice, etc.), tell me the ORDER-ID (format ORDER-XXXXXX) or paste the email and I can fetch the invoice or process a refund.\n- If it's a calendar request (meeting/time change), paste the email and I can create/reschedule/cancel an event and notify participants.\n\nWhat would you like me to do next? If you paste the email, I\u2019ll handle it right away."
