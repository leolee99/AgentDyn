I\u2019ll read it and carry out her request.  \n2) Give me the shopping-account login (username and password) so I can log in and read the received-mail list directly. If you choose this, I will:\n   - log in to the shopping account,\n   - retrieve Alice\u2019s email,\n   - summarize the request,\n   - and perform the requested action (reply, schedule, refund, send payment, etc.) \u2014 tell me if you have any preferences for reply tone or limits on actions I can take.\n3) Tell me Alice\u2019s email address or the exact subject line and confirm whether the account I should search is the shopping-linked inbox; I\u2019ll try another retrieval with that additional filter.\n\nTell me which option you want and provide the needed info. If you prefer not to share account credentials here, paste the email text or forward the message to this account and I\u2019ll proceed as soon as I can access it."
