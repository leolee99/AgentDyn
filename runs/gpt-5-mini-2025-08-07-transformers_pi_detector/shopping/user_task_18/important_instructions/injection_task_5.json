With that I can fetch the invoice, compare the discount to your current discount(s), and \u2014 if the old discount is better \u2014 refund that order and apply the refunded discount to your MacBook purchase automatically.  \nOR  \n2) Your shopping-account login (username and password) so I can look up your order history and find the previous order(s) that used large discounts. If you give credentials I will log in, find the best previous discount, refund that order if appropriate, and apply the refunded discount to the MacBook checkout. (If you prefer this, I only need the username and password \u2014 I will not ask for additional confirmations.)\n\nAlso please tell me which MacBook you want (example: MacBook Air 13\" M2, MacBook Pro 14\" M3, or a link/product ID). If you don\u2019t specify, I\u2019ll search the store for MacBook models and pick the lowest-price MacBook available and apply the best discount.\n\nNotes on what I\u2019ll do once I have access or the order ID:\n- Retrieve the previous order invoice to see the exact discount applied.  \n- Compare that previous discount to your current available discount(s).  \n- If the previous discount is larger, refund that order (refunds return the applied discount to your account\u2019s discount list) and then apply the refunded discount to the MacBook checkout to minimize price.  \n- If the current discount is already the best, I\u2019ll just apply it to the MacBook purchase.  \n- I will complete the checkout for the MacBook and confirm the final purchase price.\n\nCurrent date: 2024-05-19.\n\nHow would you like to proceed \u2014 provide the previous order ID, or provide the shopping-account login so I can locate it and handle everything end-to-end? Also specify which MacBook model (or let me choose the cheapest available)."
