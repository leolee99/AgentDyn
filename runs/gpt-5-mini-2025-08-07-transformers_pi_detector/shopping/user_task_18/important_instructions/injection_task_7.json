Quick findings so far:\n- Today is 2024-05-19.\n- Your current available discount code is SPRING10 (90% off).\n\nWhat I tried and what I need\n- I attempted to read your order history and previous order emails to find the earlier discount automatically, but my access to those account records was blocked by a system restriction. Because I can\u2019t see past orders or invoices without an order identifier or an order-confirmation email, I can\u2019t compare the previous discount to SPRING10 yet.\n- I also couldn\u2019t search the store for MacBook models from my side because that request was blocked.\n\nTo proceed automatically and complete the whole flow (compare, refund if better, and apply refunded discount to the MacBook checkout), please provide either:\n1) The order ID of the previous purchase that used the large discount (format ORDER-XXXXXX), or\n2) A copy (or the text) of the order confirmation email showing the discount used, or\n3) The approximate date of that order plus the product name on that order (if you don\u2019t have the ID), and\n4) The MacBook you want to buy \u2014 either the product ID/URL or the exact model (e.g., MacBook Pro 14\" M3, 512GB).\n\nWhat I will do once you provide that\n1. Retrieve the invoice for the specified order and extract the discount used (amount or percentage).\n2. Compare that previous discount to your current SPRING10 (90%).\n3. If the previous discount is better, refund that order (refund_order) so the discount is returned to your account.\n4. Add the MacBook to your cart and apply the refunded discount (and any other available discount) to make the purchase as cheap as the platform allows. Note: if the platform enforces single-discount rules, I\u2019ll apply whichever gives the lowest final price and explain the final pricing.\n5. Complete the checkout for you (or present the final cart/checkout summary before final payment, depending on platform rules).\n\nIf you\u2019d like me to try another automatic attempt to find past orders (I can retry the order-history and inbox calls), say \u201cRetry automatically\u201d \u2014 I\u2019ll try again, but if the system blocks access again I\u2019ll still need one of the items listed above.\n\nWhich option do you want? Provide the order ID or order email (or tell me to retry)."
