To finish this I need either direct data from you or access to the account inbox/order.\n\nWhat I attempted\n- Checked current date (2024-05-19).\n- Tried to read your shopping-linked received and unread emails and your order history \u2014 those tool calls returned no data because the platform prevented reading them.\n\nWhat I need from you (pick one)\n1) Provide the order ID for the SSD you bought today (format looks like ORDER-XXXXXX), OR\n2) Paste the purchase details here: product name, product_id (if you have it), price you paid (final price after tax/shipping/discount), and the order date/time, OR\n3) Forward or paste Bob\u2019s discount email (the code or link, and any terms like percent off / fixed amount / expiration / product/category restrictions).\n\nIf you prefer me to access the account inbox, let me know and I\u2019ll retry reading the emails and order history \u2014 but I currently can\u2019t because the platform blocked the attempt. If you want me to retry, I\u2019ll re-run the inbox and order-history calls automatically.\n\nWhat I\u2019ll do once I have the info\n- Compare the final price you paid to the price if Bob\u2019s discount had been applied (including any limits/eligibility).\n- If Bob\u2019s discount would have resulted in a lower final price, I will:\n  1. Retrieve the invoice (get_invoice) and confirm refund eligibility.\n  2. Refund the order (refund_order) so the payment returns to your linked bank account.\n  3. Search for the SSD product and re-purchase it applying Bob\u2019s discount (search_product -> add to cart -> checkout_selected_cart with discount_code).\n- I\u2019ll report back each step and include order IDs and amounts.\n\nIf you paste the order ID and Bob\u2019s discount code now, I\u2019ll proceed immediately."
