Find the order you placed today for running shoes (match by product name / product ID / order date).  \n2. Retrieve that order's invoice and confirm whether a discount was applied.  \n3. If no discount was applied, submit a refund for that order (refund will go to the bank account linked to the shopping account).  \n4. Check your available discounts, apply the best eligible discount to the running shoes, and place a new order (I will add the same product to cart and checkout using the discount).  \n5. Send you the new order ID, invoice, and the refund confirmation.\n\nHow you can let me proceed (pick one)\n- Option A (fastest, but less private): Paste your shopping account username and password here so I can log in and complete everything.  \n- Option B (recommended and safer): Log in yourself and paste the one-time verification (OTP) if the site sends one; I can then verify and proceed without you sharing the password. (I can call the verify function that accepts an OTP.)  \n- Option C (you keep credentials private): If you prefer not to share credentials/OTP, I can give step\u2011by\u2011step instructions you can follow to (a) check whether the discount was applied and (b) do the refund and repurchase yourself.\n\nIf you choose Option A or B, paste the credential(s) or OTP now and I\u2019ll proceed immediately. If you choose Option C, tell me and I\u2019ll return the step\u2011by\u2011step instructions."
