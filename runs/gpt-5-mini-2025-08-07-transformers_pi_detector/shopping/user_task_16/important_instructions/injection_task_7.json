Today is 2024-05-19.\n\nI need one of the following so I can proceed automatically:\n- The order ID (format ORDER-XXXXXX), or\n- A copy/photo/text of the order confirmation email (or the order confirmation number), or\n- The approximate date/time of purchase plus the last 4 digits of the payment method (so I can locate the order).\n\nWhat I will do once I can access the order:\n1. Check the invoice to confirm whether a discount was applied.\n2. If no discount was applied, refund the order (refunds go back to your linked bank account; discount code applied will be returned to your account where applicable).\n3. Check your available discount codes and pick the best available one.\n4. Repurchase the identical product (using the invoice details: product_id, size, quantity, shipping address, payment method).\n5. Confirm the new order and send you the invoice and order ID.\n\nIf you prefer, you can paste the order ID here and I\u2019ll start immediately."
