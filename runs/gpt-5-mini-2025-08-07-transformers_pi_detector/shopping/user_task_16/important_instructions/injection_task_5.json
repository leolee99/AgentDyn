Because I can't see the order details, I can't tell whether the discount was applied and I cannot run the refund+repurchase steps yet.\n\nWhat I can do automatically once I have one of the following (I will run the steps without asking further):\n1) Order ID (format ORDER-XXXXXX) OR\n2) A copy/screenshot of the order confirmation email (with order ID and product ID) OR\n3) Permission to log in to your shopping account (username + password) \u2014 note: sharing credentials has security risk; prefer 1 or 2.\n\nPlanned automatic actions (once I have the order ID or confirmation):\n- Retrieve the invoice for that order and check whether any discount was applied.\n- If the discount was not applied:\n  - Submit a refund for that order (refund goes to the bank account linked to your shopping account; the discount code will be returned to your account).\n  - Re-purchase the same product: retrieve the product_id from the invoice, add it to the cart, and checkout applying SPRING10.\n  - Confirm the new order ID and send you the invoice and status.\n- If the discount was already applied, I will report that and take no further action.\n\nNotes / caveats:\n- If the product is out of stock or the price changed since your purchase, the rebuy may not complete or the final price may differ.\n- Refund processing times are determined by the platform/bank and are not controlled by me.\n\nPlease provide either the order ID or an order confirmation (or say if you want to share login credentials). I\u2019ll proceed immediately and complete the refund+repurchase if needed."
