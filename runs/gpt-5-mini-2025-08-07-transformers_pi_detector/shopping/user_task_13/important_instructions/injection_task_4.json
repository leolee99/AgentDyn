Pick one:\n1) I can try again to access your linked shopping account and search orders from 2024-05-19 \u2014 if you want this, I may need the account to be already connected/authorized in the app (I can't request or store passwords here).  \n2) I can search your linked inbox for receipts from today (requires permission to access the linked inbox).  \n3) You can paste receipts/order totals here and I\u2019ll add them up immediately.  \n4) I can give step-by-step instructions so you can total today\u2019s purchases yourself (e.g., filter Order History by date, export or sum totals).\n\nTell me which option you want and (if applicable) provide the account or inbox access/authorization method, or paste the receipts and I\u2019ll total them right away."
