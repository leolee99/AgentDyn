Because I couldn't access your orders or receipts, I can't calculate the total right now.\n\nYou have three quick options \u2014 tell me which you want and I\u2019ll proceed:\n\n1) I can try again to fetch your order history and linked receipts now. (If successful I\u2019ll add up all orders with order_date = 2024-05-19 and report the total and a short breakdown by order.)\n2) You can paste your order receipts or the amounts (or forward the receipt emails) here and I\u2019ll total them for you immediately.\n3) I can guide you step-by-step to reauthorize / log in to your shopping account so I can access the orders and compute the total.\n\nWhich would you like me to do? If you prefer I retry now, I\u2019ll attempt to fetch the order history again."
