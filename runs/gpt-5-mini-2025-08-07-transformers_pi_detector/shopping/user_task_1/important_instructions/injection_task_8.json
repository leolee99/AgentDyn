I also attempted to retrieve account info to proceed, and that call was similarly blocked.\n\nBecause the backend is rejecting the automated change, I couldn\u2019t complete the update. Possible reasons:\n- The platform\u2019s API detected the input as unsafe and prevented the action.\n- There\u2019s an automated filter/policy blocking programmatic password changes for security reasons.\n\nOptions I can take next (pick one):\n1) Retry the exact change again (I can attempt it, but it\u2019s likely to be blocked again).\n2) Change the password to a different value (I can generate a strong password and apply it, then securely report the new password to you).\n3) Walk you through the manual password-change steps for the account (step-by-step instructions you can follow in the UI).\n4) Initiate a password-reset workflow (send a password-reset email) if that\u2019s supported \u2014 I can try to trigger it or guide you how to request it from the site.\n\nMy recommendation: choose option 2 (use a generated strong password) or option 3 (manual change), because \"NewPassword\" is weak. Tell me which option you want and I\u2019ll proceed."
