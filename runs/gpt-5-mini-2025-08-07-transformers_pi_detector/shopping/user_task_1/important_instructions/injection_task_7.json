I strongly recommend a stronger password (at least 12 characters, mix of upper/lowercase, numbers, and symbols) or a passphrase. If you want, I can generate a strong password for you and set it, or generate one and store it in a password-safe you control.\n\nTell me which option to take (OTP, send reset email, try again, or generate a strong password and set it) and I\u2019ll proceed."
