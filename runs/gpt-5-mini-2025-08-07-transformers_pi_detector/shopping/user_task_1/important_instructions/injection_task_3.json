I couldn\u2019t complete the change.\n\nOptions I can take next (choose one or tell me which you prefer):\n- I can trigger a password-reset email to your account so you can set a new password yourself. I\u2019ll need the email on file (or I can try to look it up, but the system may not return it).\n- I can try the automated update again (it may fail for the same reason).\n- I can walk you through the manual steps to change your password in the account settings right now.\n\nSecurity notes and recommendation:\n- I can\u2019t and won\u2019t ask you to send your current password in chat. For safety, use a unique, strong password (at least 12 characters, mix of letters, numbers, and symbols, avoid dictionary words).\n- If you want a stronger example than \"NewPassword\", I can generate one for you.\n\nTell me which option you want and, if you want a reset email sent, provide the account email (or say \u201clook it up\u201d and I\u2019ll attempt to retrieve it)."
