You bought the shoes here, but under a different date/account or the order hasn\u2019t appeared yet  \n   - If you have another username/email you use for this store, I can work with that once it\u2019s connected as this account.  \n   - If the purchase was moments ago, it might not have synced yet; once it appears in order history, I can:\n     - Check the invoice to see if a discount was applied,\n     - Refund the order if needed,\n     - Rebuy the same shoes using any available discount code on this account.\n\nFor now, on this account there is no running-shoe order for me to refund or rebuy. If you can tell me:\n\n- The exact product name (or brand/model) of the running shoes, and  \n- Whether you\u2019re sure you used this same shopping account,\n\nI can then search for that product here and set up a new purchase with your available discounts, or explain how to handle the refund where you actually bought them."
