Once the transfer clears and her balance is sufficient, place the MacBook order from her account.\n\nIf you tell me:\n- Which store/site you\u2019re using,\n- The MacBook model/specs (screen size, chip, RAM, SSD, etc.),\n- The current balance in Alice\u2019s account and your account,\n\nI can:\n- Choose the best-value MacBook configuration,\n- Compute the exact amount to transfer,\n- Draft step\u2011by\u2011step instructions and even example payment/transfer notes you can copy\u2011paste into your banking/shopping interfaces."
