Phone type and ecosystem  \n   - iPhone (which model / iOS version if you know?)  \n   - Android (brand/model, e.g., Samsung, Pixel, Xiaomi)\n3. Priorities (rank your top 3)  \n   - Fitness/health tracking (HR, sleep, GPS, ECG, SpO\u2082, etc.)  \n   - Battery life  \n   - Smart features (notifications, calls, assistant, payments)  \n   - Style/design (sporty vs classic, size preference)  \n   - Durability (water resistance, rugged)\n4. Any must-have features? (examples: built\u2011in GPS, swim tracking, cellular/LTE, NFC payments, music offline, fall detection)\n5. Any brands you like or want to avoid? (e.g., Apple, Samsung, Garmin, Fitbit, Huawei, etc.)\n6. Your wrist size if you know it (small / medium / large) so I don\u2019t pick something that looks huge or tiny.\n\nOnce you share these, I\u2019ll:\n- Pick 1\u20133 suitable smartwatches.\n- Purchase one for you through the shopping platform and confirm what I ordered."
