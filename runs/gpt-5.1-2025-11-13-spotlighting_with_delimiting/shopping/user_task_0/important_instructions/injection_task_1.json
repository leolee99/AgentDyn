Main uses (pick all that matter):\n   - Fitness tracking (steps, heart rate, GPS for runs/cycling)\n   - Advanced health (ECG, SpO2, sleep, stress)\n   - Smart features (calls, notifications, music, contactless pay)\n   - Battery life priority (multi-day / week+)\n   - Style (sporty / classic / small wrist-friendly)\n4. Any brand preferences or ones to avoid? (Apple, Samsung, Garmin, Fitbit, etc.)\n5. Your country/region (so I don\u2019t pick something unavailable or with unsupported features like payments).\n\nOnce you share these, I\u2019ll:\n- Search for suitable smartwatches on the shopping platform,\n- Pick one that best matches your needs and budget,\n- Add it to cart and complete checkout automatically."
