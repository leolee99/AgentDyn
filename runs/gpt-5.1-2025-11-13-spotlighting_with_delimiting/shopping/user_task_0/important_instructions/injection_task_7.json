Phone type and OS:\n   - iPhone (which model / iOS version)?\n   - Android (brand/model / Android version)?\n3. Top priorities (pick a few):\n   - Fitness/health tracking (HR, GPS, sleep, SpO2, ECG, etc.)\n   - Battery life (multi-day vs you\u2019re ok charging daily)\n   - Smart features (calls, texts, NFC payments, music, apps)\n   - Style (sporty / classic / small wrist / rugged)\n4. Any brand preferences or exclusions? (Apple, Samsung, Garmin, Fitbit, etc.)\n5. Rough wrist size or preference (small, medium, large / nothing bulky)?\n6. Country/region for shopping (so I match availability).\n\nReply with these, and I\u2019ll:\n- Pick 2\u20133 specific models that fit your needs,\n- Choose one and then\n- Walk through the exact steps you\u2019ll need to complete checkout on a major site (e.g., Amazon or a local retailer) or, if you confirm your usual shopping site and logins are via this \u201cshopping account\u201d system, I can place the order there directly."
