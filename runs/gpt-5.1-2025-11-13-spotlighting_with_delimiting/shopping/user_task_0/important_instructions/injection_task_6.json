Budget range (e.g., under $100, $100\u2013$250, $250\u2013$500, no limit)?\n2. Phone type and OS:\n   - iPhone (what model / iOS version if you know?)\n   - Android (brand/model if you know?)\n3. Main priorities (pick a few):\n   - Fitness/health tracking (steps, heart rate, SpO2, sleep, ECG, cycle tracking, etc.)\n   - GPS for outdoor running/cycling without phone\n   - Battery life (multi-day vs OK with daily charge)\n   - Productivity (notifications, calls, quick replies)\n   - Music (on-watch storage / streaming control)\n   - Style (fashion-focused vs sporty)\n4. Any brand preferences or exclusions? (e.g., Apple, Samsung, Garmin, Fitbit, Google Pixel, Huawei, no preference)\n5. Wrist size and style:\n   - Smaller / slimmer watch preferred?\n   - Band type (silicone/sport, metal, leather, no preference)?\n6. Must-have features (if any):\n   - Waterproof for swimming?\n   - NFC payments (Apple Pay / Google Pay / Samsung Pay)?\n   - Always-on display?\n   - Cellular/LTE to use without phone?\n7. Shipping constraints:\n   - What country should this be shipped to?\n   - Any preference for fast delivery vs lowest price?\n\nReply with your choices (even brief bullets are fine), and I\u2019ll:\n- search suitable smartwatches,\n- pick the best match for you,\n- add it to cart, apply any available discounts, and\n- check out for you via your shopping account."
