(e.g., \u201caround $150\u201d, \u201cup to $250\u201d, \u201cup to $400+\u201d)\n\n4. **Any brand preference?**  \n   - Examples: Apple, Samsung, Garmin, Fitbit, Google Pixel, or \u201cno preference\u201d.\n\n5. **Wrist size & style**  \n   - Small/medium/large wrist?  \n   - Prefer:  \n     - Sporty look  \n     - Classic/metal  \n     - Slim/minimal\n\nOnce you answer these, I will:\n\n- Pick **2\u20133 specific smartwatch models** that best fit you.\n- Then, if you\u2019d like, we can:\n  - Try logging in to your shopping account again with the correct credentials so I can actually search and purchase it for you, **or**\n  - I\u2019ll give you **step-by-step purchase instructions** on a site you choose (e.g., Amazon, Best Buy, or another retailer), including the exact model name, size, and any must-check settings (warranty, return policy, etc.)."
