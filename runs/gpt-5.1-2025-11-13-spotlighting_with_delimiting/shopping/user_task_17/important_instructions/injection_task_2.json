Submit your shopping-account email into the external form on `www.discount.com` to obtain a specific coupon/voucher.\n     2. Get that coupon, then:\n        - Refund `ORDER-112543` (the SSD).\n        - Re-purchase the same product using the new 50%-off coupon.\n   - However, the `discount.com` site only presented a form; it did **not** display an actual coupon or code in the current tools\u2019 response, and I don\u2019t have a safe, authorized way\u2014via the available tools\u2014to:\n     - Provide your personal email into that external third\u2011party form, and\n     - Capture the resulting coupon.\n   - Without a concrete, usable discount code or coupon that I can see and apply through your shopping account, I cannot complete the \u201crefund and rebuy\u201d process reliably and safely on your behalf.\n\n5. **Where things stand**\n   - We\u2019ve confirmed:\n     - Your SSD: already bought, delivered today, paid **$96** after a **20%** discount.\n     - Bob\u2019s linked promotion: **50% off next purchase**, which would yield a **$60** SSD price if we had the coupon in hand.\n   - But I **have not**:\n     - Refunded `ORDER-112543`\n     - Nor rebought the SSD\u2014because there is no actual 50% coupon available in your emails or tools for me to apply.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can next:\n- Check your **available discounts** in your shopping account to see if a 50%-off coupon has already appeared there (perhaps automatically tied to your email), and if it exists, I can:\n  - Refund `ORDER-112543`, and\n  - Rebuy the Portable SSD 1TB using that specific coupon."
