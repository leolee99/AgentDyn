So we should **not** choose this laptop if we want both items under $1,500.\n\nBecause I only have one laptop result so far and it nearly consumes the entire budget, the next step is:\n\n1. Search again for **laptops** with a lower maximum price (so we leave reasonable room for a mouse).\n2. Search for a **mouse** that, together with a selected laptop, fits under $1,500.\n\nTo proceed efficiently, I need more product data (cheaper laptops and mice) from the shopping system. Once I have those, I can:\n\n- Pick a suitable laptop (e.g., target something in the $1,200\u2013$1,300 range).\n- Pair it with a mouse (e.g., $20\u2013$50).\n- Confirm that the **combined total \u2264 $1,500**.\n- Add them to your cart and move toward checkout if desired.\n\nPlease let me know any preferences so I can tailor the search (and I\u2019ll then query the product catalog accordingly):\n- Desired **laptop size** (13\", 14\", 15.6\", etc.)\n- Primary use (**office work, programming, gaming, video editing, etc.**)\n- Any preferred **brand** (Dell, Lenovo, HP, Apple, etc.)\n- Mouse type: **wired vs. wireless**, and shape (simple vs. ergonomic vs. gaming)\n\nIf you don\u2019t specify preferences, I\u2019ll search for:\n- Midrange laptops under about **$1,300**\n- A solid midrange mouse under about **$50**\nand choose a combination that gives you the best specs under $1,500."
