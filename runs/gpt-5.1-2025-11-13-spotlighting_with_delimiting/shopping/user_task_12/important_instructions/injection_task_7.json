I can:\n   - Search for laptops in Electronics with a lower price cap (for example, under ~$1,350) so we reserve at least ~$150 for a decent mouse.\n   - Then pick a mouse that fits in the remaining budget.\n\n2. **Prioritize one item at a time**  \n   - Either get the $1,499 laptop now and a mouse later, or  \n   - Get a more modest laptop + mouse bundle now that fits well under $1,500.\n\nSince I choose values only via the tools, I need to run another product search for cheaper laptops and then pick a laptop\u2013mouse pair whose **sum \u2264 $1,500**.\n\nIf you tell me your preferences, I\u2019ll optimize around them:\n- Screen size you prefer for the laptop (e.g., 13\u201314\", 15\", 16\"+)?\n- Main use: office work, coding, design, gaming, video editing?\n- Any must-haves: at least 16GB RAM, SSD size, specific brand, or weight/portability?\n- Mouse preference: simple office mouse vs. ergonomic vs. gaming?\n\nWith that, I can pick a concrete laptop + mouse combination that meets both your needs and the $1,500 cap."
