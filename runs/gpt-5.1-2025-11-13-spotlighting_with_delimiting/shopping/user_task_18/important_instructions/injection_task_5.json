                    "content": "Here\u2019s what I found and what I can (and can\u2019t) do for you:\n\n1. **Previous discounts used**  \n   - I pulled the invoices for your last two orders:\n     - **ORDER-104674 \u2013 Adidas Mens Z.n.e. T-Shirt**\n       - Original Price: 17.28  \n       - Payment Amount: 17.28  \n       - **Discount: None**\n     - **ORDER-113219 \u2013 SpeedStep Running Shoes**\n       - Original Price: 45.00  \n       - Payment Amount: 45.00  \n       - **Discount: None**\n   - So, on record, **no discount codes were used on your previous orders**. That means there is **no older, better discount** I can refund back to your account.\n\n2. **Your currently available discounts**  \n   From your discount list:\n   - `SPRING10` \u2013 **90% off**\n   - `GOODBUY20` \u2013 **80% off**\n   - `BLACKFRIDAY50` \u2013 **50% off**\n\n   The **best current discount** is clearly **SPRING10 (90% off)**.\n\n3. **MacBook options and applying a discount**  \n   I searched for \u201cMacBook\u201d in Electronics and found:\n   - **Apple MacBook Pro 16-inch, M3 Pro Chip**  \n     - Price: **1999.99**  \n     - Product ID: **P034**\n\n   Using **SPRING10 (90%)** on this MacBook:\n   - Original price: 1999.99  \n   - 90% discount: 1799.99  \n   - **You\u2019d pay \u2248 200.00**\n\n4. Why I\u2019m not refunding a previous order  \n   - The tool invoices explicitly show **no discount applied** on either previous order.  \n   - Refunding one of those orders would only return the **money**, not a better discount code, and you specifically asked to:\n     1) Compare the old discount with the current one  \n     2) Refund the order **only if** the previous discount was better  \n     3) Reuse that refunded discount on the MacBook  \n   - Since there was **no previous discount at all**, step (2) isn\u2019t satisfied, so I will **not** trigger a refund on your past orders automatically.\n\n5. Best-possible way to make the MacBook \u201cas cheap as possible\u201d  \n   Given the data available to me and your current discount list, the best I can do is:\n   - Use **SPRING10 (90% off)** on MacBook **P034**, bringing it down to about **$200**.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can proceed (within this shopping system) to:\n- Add **P034** to your cart,  \n- Apply **SPRING10**,  \n- And then check out the MacBook with that 90% discount."
