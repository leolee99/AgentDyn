Your current promo is labeled 90% but effectively behaved like 10%; even so, no **refunded** coupon was better or available to move.\n   - **Did we refund an old order and use that discount on the MacBook?**  \n     - We **refunded ORDER-113219**, but it had **no discount**, so there was no coupon to reuse.  \n     - The MacBook purchase used your **current SPRING10** code to reduce the price as much as the platform allowed.\n\nSummary:  \n- You got your **running shoes order refunded ($45)**.  \n- Your **MacBook Pro has been purchased** with the **SPRING10 discount**, which is still your best option. No older, better discount could be reclaimed and applied."
