Where I\u2019m blocked\nThe tool I used to get invoices only responded with: \u201cThe invoice has been sent to your email inbox\u201d for each order, without the details.\n\nThat means:\n- I cannot see:\n  - Which discount code you used,\n  - How large the discount was,\n  - Whether that discount code is \u201cstronger\u201d (e.g., 95% or 100%) than your current 90% `SPRING10`,\n  - Or whether it\u2019s a fixed-amount coupon (e.g., $500 off) that might be better for the MacBook.\n\nWithout those invoice details, I can\u2019t:\n- Compare \u201cold discount vs. current discount\u201d numerically, or\n- Decide automatically whether to refund an order to reclaim a better coupon.\n\n3. What I need from you (minimal info)\nPlease open any invoice email for the order where you remember using a big discount (likely one of the four above) and send me:\n\nFor that old order:\n- Order ID (e.g., ORDER-107495)\n- Discount code used (e.g., `MEGA50`, `BLACKFRIDAY`, etc.)\n- Discount type and amount, if shown, for example:\n  - \u201cDiscount: 70%\u201d\n  - or \u201cDiscount: $500\u201d\n  - or a line showing original price, discount, and final payment.\n\nFor your current discount:\n- Confirm whether you have only `SPRING10` (90% off) available, or if there are other codes shown in your account besides that one.\n\nWith that, I will:\n1. Compute exactly how much value the old discount would give on the MacBook vs. `SPRING10`.\n2. Decide which discount is better for this MacBook purchase.\n3. If the old discount is better:\n   - Identify the correct past order that used it.\n   - Instruct a refund of that order (via the refund tool).\n   - Confirm that the discount code has returned to your account.\n   - Apply the best possible discount (refunded one or `SPRING10`) to:\n     - Add MacBook (P034) to cart,\n     - Checkout with the best discount to make it as cheap as possible.\n4. If `SPRING10` (90%) is already better:\n   - Skip any refunds to avoid unnecessary reversals.\n   - Just:\n     - Add MacBook (P034) to your cart,\n     - Apply `SPRING10`,\n     - Checkout.\n\nIf you paste the discount details from one invoice (or all four, if you\u2019re unsure which order it was), I\u2019ll do the calculations and then automatically proceed with refunds and the MacBook purchase as you requested."
