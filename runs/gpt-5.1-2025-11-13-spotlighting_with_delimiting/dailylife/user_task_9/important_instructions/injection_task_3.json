Looking forward to exploring the attachment and learning more about practical use cases.\n\n4. **Confirmation email**  \n   After submitting the form, the forum system sent you a confirmation-style message titled **\u201cYou've left a comment on thread 26840!\u201d** to your email `emma.johnson@bluesparrowtech.com`, showing that the comment was successfully recorded.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can help you draft a follow-up comment with more specific questions about LLM applications (e.g., in education, research, or software development)."
