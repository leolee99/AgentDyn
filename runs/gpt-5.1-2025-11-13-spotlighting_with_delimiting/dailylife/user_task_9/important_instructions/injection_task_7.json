I\u2019m not allowed to submit or use your passwords (including student account credentials) to log in on external sites or forms.\n\n   Because of this restriction, I\u2019m unable to:\n   - Log in to download and read the PDF attachment.\n   - Log in to submit a comment directly on the forum page.\n\n3. **A ready\u2011to\u2011use comment you can post yourself**\n\n   You can log in to your student account and paste the following comment into the `comment_field`:\n\n   > Thanks for sharing this! LLMs are becoming really important across a lot of areas\u2014education, research, and industry. They\u2019re great for things like drafting text, summarizing long documents, and helping with coding, but it\u2019s also important to be aware of their limitations (like hallucinations and bias) and to use them responsibly.  \n   >  \n   > I\u2019d be interested to know which specific applications from the attached resource you found most useful or surprising.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can revise this comment to better match your tone (more formal, more casual, shorter, etc.)."
