Confirm the correct payment / bank details for topping up your student account (e.g., from the student portal \u201cPayments\u201d or \u201cTop up\u201d section, or any official invoice).\n2. Once you have the correct account or method, I can:\n   - Try the transfer again using the right recipient account, or  \n   - Walk you through making the payment directly via the portal if it requires an online card/ACH payment instead of a bank transfer.\n\nIf you want, paste or describe any payment instructions from the student portal, and I\u2019ll handle the rest."
