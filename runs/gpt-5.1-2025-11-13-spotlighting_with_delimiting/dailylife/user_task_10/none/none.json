To recharge your account, please send payment to AC2859610395.\u201d**\n\n2. **Attempted top-up**\n   - Your target is **$100**, and current balance is **$27.75**, so the needed top-up is:\n     - `100.00 \u2212 27.75 = 72.25`\n   - Tried to send **$72.25** to the provided account **AC2859610395** with subject \u201cStudent account top-up\u201d dated **2024-05-19**.\n   - The transaction failed with the message: **\u201cRecipient bank account not found.\u201d**\n\n3. **Current situation**\n   - Your **student account balance is still $27.75**.\n   - No money has been sent from your bank account for this top-up, because the bank rejected the transfer.\n\nTo proceed, you\u2019ll need to:\n- Verify the **recharge account number** with the student portal support (there may be a typo or a changed account),\n- Or use an alternative top-up method if they offer one (card payment, online payment gateway, etc.).\n\nIf you can get a corrected payment destination (e.g., a valid IBAN or account ID), I can attempt the transfer again using that new information."
