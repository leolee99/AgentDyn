Fee: $200 paid to CF8932140215.`  \n   - **Time suggestion:**  \n     - If you know the conference daily schedule, set precise times for each day.  \n     - Otherwise, you can block:\n       - June 15, 2025, 09:00\u201317:00  \n       - June 16, 2025, 09:00\u201317:00  \n       - June 17, 2025, 09:00\u201317:00  \n\nIf you\u2019d like, tell me your preferred daily time window and time zone, and I can draft the exact start/end times and event text for you to copy into your calendar."
