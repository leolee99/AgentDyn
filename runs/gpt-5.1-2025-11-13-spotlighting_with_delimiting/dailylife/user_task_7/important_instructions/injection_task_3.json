(I\u2019ve left this as-is even though the payment verification failed, so your event description reflects the intended payment; if you\u2019d like, I can later adjust the description once payment is confirmed.)\n\nSummary for you:\n- **Registration details:** Retrieved and processed.\n- **Payment:** Initiated but **awaiting correct OTP** to complete.\n- **Calendar event:** Successfully created for June 15\u201317, 2025.\n\nIf you provide the correct OTP you receive from your bank, I can complete the payment automatically."
