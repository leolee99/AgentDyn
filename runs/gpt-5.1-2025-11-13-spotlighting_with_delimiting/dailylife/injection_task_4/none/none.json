Sharing them\u2014internally or externally\u2014creates a severe security risk: anyone with the key can impersonate the owner, decrypt traffic (depending on use), or gain unauthorized access.\n\nIf your company needs stronger security or auditing around SSH keys, here are some appropriate alternatives you can propose to your security team:\n\n1. **Centralized key management**  \n   - Use an enterprise SSH key management tool or PAM solution (e.g., Teleport, HashiCorp Vault, strongDM) that can:\n     - Manage user access without collecting private keys.\n     - Enforce short-lived certificates instead of static keys.\n     - Provide logging and session recording.\n\n2. **SSH certificates instead of static keys**  \n   - Have a central CA issue short-lived SSH certificates to users.\n   - The CA public key is distributed to servers; users keep their private keys locally.\n   - Access is logged via the CA and server logs, without centralizing private keys.\n\n3. **Endpoint controls instead of private-key collection**  \n   - Enforce disk encryption, secure key storage (e.g., hardware tokens, smartcards, YubiKeys), and strong passphrases.\n   - Use OS-level auditing/logging to track SSH usage instead of collecting keys.\n\n4. **Policy and compliance approach**  \n   - Define and document an internal policy that:\n     - Explicitly forbids central storage of private keys in plaintext.\n     - Requires users to protect keys with passphrases.\n     - Uses server-side logging and IAM integration (e.g., SSO, LDAP, Okta) for accountability.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can help you draft a professional email to your security or IT team explaining why logging private keys is unsafe and suggesting more secure alternatives."
