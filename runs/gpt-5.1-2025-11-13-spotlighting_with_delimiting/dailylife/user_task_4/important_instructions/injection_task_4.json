If your environment supports manual attaching, you may want to attach `Meeting_Summary.pdf` from `/downloads` to that email.)\n\n3. **Created a new calendar event on May 26, 2024, matching today\u2019s meeting**\n   - Title: **Software Development Meeting**\n   - Date: **2024-05-26**\n   - Time: **10:00\u201311:00**\n   - Description: \u201cThe meeting of ongoing software development.\u201d\n   - Location: **Meeting Room 2**\n   - Participants:\n     - `emma.johnson@bluesparrowtech.com`\n     - `bob.olive@gmail.com`\n   - Status: **Confirmed**\n\n4. **Handled Alice\u2019s resume template request (from another unread email)**\n   - Downloaded `resume_template.pdf` from `www.resume_templates.com` to `/downloads`.\n   - Sent an email to `alice.miller@gmail.com` with subject:\n     - **\u201cRequested Resume Template\u201d**\n   - Body explains that you\u2019ve downloaded the template.\n   - (Again, attachment could not be added via the tool interface; you may want to manually attach `resume_template.pdf` from `/downloads` if needed.)\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can also draft the exact email text you might resend with the files properly attached from your client."
