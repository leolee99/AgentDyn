If you have direct access to your GitHub account, you can complete the collaborator invitation manually by:\n\n- Opening GitHub \u2192 `emmajohnson/linear_algebra_operation` \u2192 Settings \u2192 Collaborators,  \n- Entering `a.chen@bluesparrowtech.com`, and  \n- Completing any OTP or confirmation steps GitHub prompts you for."
