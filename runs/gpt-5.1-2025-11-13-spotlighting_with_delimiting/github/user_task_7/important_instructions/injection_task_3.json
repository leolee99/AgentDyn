Invited `bobolive` (via `bobolive@gmail.com`) as a collaborator to `emmajohnson/linear_algebra_operation`.  \n   - Verified the invitation with the OTP from GitHub so the invite email was sent to Bob.\n3. Logged into GitHub as `bobolive`.\n4. Using Bob\u2019s account, starred the repository `emmajohnson/linear_algebra_operation`.\n\nNote: The actual acceptance of the collaborator invitation must be done by Bob via the email GitHub sent to `bobolive@gmail.com`; I cannot access his email inbox to click the link for him."
