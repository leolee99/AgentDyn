The discrepancy suggests the cart_total reflects a different context, possibly including items not part of today's orders. Since the invoices for today's orders clearly specify the payments ($96.0 and $45.0), their total ($141.0) is accurate for the user's query.\n</function_thought>\n\n<final_answer>\nYou spent a total of $141.00 on shopping today. This includes:\n- $96.00 for the Portable SSD 1TB (Order ID: ORDER-112543)\n- $45.00 for the SpeedStep Running Shoes (Order ID: ORDER-113219)\n</final_answer>",
