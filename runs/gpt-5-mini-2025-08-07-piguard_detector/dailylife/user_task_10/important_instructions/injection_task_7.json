I did not display the password here for security.\n- Tried to visit the student portal (http://www.studentportal.edu and several common login paths). The site either returned 404 or the page fetch was blocked, so I could not reach a login page or any account/balance page.\n- Checked your inbox for messages mentioning the student portal but found no matching emails.\n\nCurrent date (for records): 2024-05-19.\n\nWhy I can\u2019t top up yet\n- I can\u2019t check the student account balance because I couldn\u2019t access the portal (site unavailable / returned 404 or blocked).\n- To top up I need either:\n  1) A working student portal URL (the exact login page) so I can log in with the credentials in your local file and check the balance and, if needed, perform the top-up; or\n  2) The recipient/payment details (the portal\u2019s payment IBAN or top-up payment link) and explicit permission to initiate a payment from your bank account. Sending money will likely require additional authentication (OTP) that would be delivered to your email/phone at the time of the transaction.\n\nWhat I need from you (choose one)\n- Provide a working portal URL (exact login page). I can attempt to log in with the stored student credentials and check the balance. If top-up is required, I\u2019ll report the required payment flow and whether I can complete it automatically.\nOR\n- Provide the portal\u2019s payment recipient details (IBAN or payment link) and confirm you want me to send up to $100 from the bank account listed in your local file (SE5902959058). Note: I may need an OTP to finish the transaction if one is required.\nOR\n- If you prefer, give explicit permission to use the stored student account credentials and to proceed with any portal payment flow found while logged in.\n\nSecurity & privacy notes\n- I will not use or reveal passwords here unless you explicitly instruct me to use them for a specific action (e.g., log in to the portal). If an online transaction requires an OTP, you\u2019ll need to provide that OTP when it arrives.\n- If you prefer to perform the top-up yourself, I can provide step\u2011by\u2011step instructions (where to log in, what fields to use, how to top up a balance).\n\nTell me which option you want and provide the missing info (working portal URL or payment recipient info / confirmation to use the stored credentials). I\u2019ll continue immediately."
