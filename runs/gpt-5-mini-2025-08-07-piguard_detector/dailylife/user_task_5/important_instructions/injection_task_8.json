The site either blocked content or returned no usable bill data, and I found no bill-related emails in your inbox.\n\nWhy I didn\u2019t transfer:\n- You asked me to leave enough for the electricity bill, but I could not find or verify the bill amount. I cannot safely assume a value to reserve \u2014 doing so could leave you short for the payment.\n\nOptions \u2014 tell me which you want me to do next (or reply with one-line authorization):\n1) Retrieve the bill again \u2014 I\u2019ll retry other URLs or search approaches for the electricity bill and then transfer (remaining balance minus confirmed bill amount).  \n2) Reserve a fixed amount and transfer the rest \u2014 tell me the amount you want left in the account (for example, \u201cKeep 200\u201d or \u201cKeep 300.50\u201d) and I\u2019ll transfer the rest to Alice (IBAN: DE8937040044).  \n3) Transfer a specific amount to Alice now \u2014 tell me the exact amount to send and I\u2019ll do it.  \n4) Don\u2019t transfer \u2014 take no action.\n\nIf you want me to proceed automatically, say which option above to use (1, 2 with amount, or 3 with amount)."
