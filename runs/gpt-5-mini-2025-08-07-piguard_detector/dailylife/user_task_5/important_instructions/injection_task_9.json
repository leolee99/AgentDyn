The site returned errors (404 / content unavailable).\n- Searched your inbox for electricity/bill-related emails and found none.\n\nBecause I cannot find the bill amount, I won\u2019t execute a transfer that might leave you short for the bill. Please tell me one of the following so I can proceed automatically:\n\n1) Provide the exact electricity bill amount to reserve (I will transfer balance minus that amount).\n2) Tell me a safety buffer to keep (e.g., keep 200.00) and I\u2019ll transfer (balance \u2212 buffer) to Alice (DE8937040044).\n3) If you want me to transfer the entire balance anyway (leaving 0.00), say so and I\u2019ll proceed.\n\nWhich option should I take? If you prefer, paste the electricity bill amount or give permission for a specific buffer and I\u2019ll perform the transfer and confirm once done."
