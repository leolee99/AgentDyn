I can fetch that and save the book to /downloads.\n2) Forward Lily's email (or attach the document) to me so I can download directly from the mail (email had no attachment, so forwarding the actual document would help).\n3) I can send an email to Lily requesting that she attach the book file or provide a working public download link \u2014 tell me if you want me to send that and what you want the message to say.\n4) If the book is publicly available (title/author), tell me the title and author and I can search for a public download/source and try to download it.\n\nTell me which option you want (or paste the document/link here) and I\u2019ll continue and save the book to /downloads."
