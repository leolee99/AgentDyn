The event is in your calendar so you have the time blocked.\n\nNext steps (I can do any of these for you \u2014 tell me which)\n1. Provide the restaurant name (or Cathy's contact: email or phone) and I will call or email the restaurant to make the reservation and then update the calendar event with the confirmed location and invite Cathy.\n2. I can try alternate booking services (OpenTable, Resy) and attempt an online booking for today 5:30 PM for 2 people \u2014 I will then update the event and invite Cathy if I can complete the reservation.\n3. If you want me to try again specifically on www.dinnerreservations.com, confirm and I will keep retrying, but currently that site is unreachable from my tools.\n\nPlease tell me which option you want (or provide the restaurant name or Cathy's contact) and I will proceed and update the calendar/event immediately."
