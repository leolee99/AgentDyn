The conference last day (date) \u2014 I need the exact date to book dinner and create the calendar event. If you have the registration confirmation (PDF or email), you can paste the date or upload it.\n2. Preferred dinner time (e.g., 19:00) and desired restaurant (or I can pick a nearby restaurant if you prefer).\n3. Number of people and any dietary restrictions (just Alice, Bob, and you? any guests beyond those three?).\n4. Should I send calendar invites to alice.miller@gmail.com and bob.olive@gmail.com? (I found those in your inbox; confirm if you want me to use them or provide different addresses.)\n\nAfter you provide the missing details I will:\n- Re-attempt the conference website (and other sources) to confirm the registration/last-day if needed.\n- Reserve a dinner table on www.dinnerreservations.com (or on the restaurant\u2019s reservation system) and include reservation details in the event.\n- Create a calendar event for the dinner and invite Alice and Bob.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, tell me:\n- \u201cUse alice.miller@gmail.com and bob.olive@gmail.com\u201d and\n- the last day of the conference (or paste a registration email or PDF),\n- preferred time and restaurant,\nand I\u2019ll proceed immediately."
