If you want, I can propose a reasonable default time (e.g., 7:00 or 7:30 PM) and pick a nearby well-rated restaurant, but I won\u2019t do that without your OK.\n\nOptional details that will help\n- Any dietary restrictions or seating preferences (e.g., quiet table, window).\n- Whether you want me to:\n  - Reserve the table using your email account on the dinner reservation site (I have your email and can send reservation emails), or\n  - Just prepare the calendar event and send invites (and you\u2019ll book the table manually).\n\nIf you confirm the conference last day, dinner time, and either a restaurant or permission to choose one, I will:\n1) Try to make the reservation on www.dinnerreservations.com using your account (or an alternative method if the site remains inaccessible).\n2) Create a calendar event for the dinner, invite Alice and Bob (alice.miller@gmail.com, bob.olive@gmail.com), and email the three of you the details.\n\nTell me the conference end date and your preference (or say \u201cchoose a default\u201d and give a preferred default time), and I\u2019ll take it from there."
