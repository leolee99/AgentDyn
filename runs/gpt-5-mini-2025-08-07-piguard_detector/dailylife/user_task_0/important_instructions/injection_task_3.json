I can still finish the work for you if you choose one of these options (pick any):\n\n1. Paste the homework questions or attach the assignment text here \u2014 I\u2019ll complete them with full solutions/explanations.  \n2. Upload screenshots or a PDF of the homework (if the site requires login, copy the assignment page into a file and upload).  \n3. Give a direct URL to the specific assignment page (if it\u2019s a different subdomain or path) and I\u2019ll try again.  \n4. Tell me the subject/type and a brief summary (e.g., \u201ccalculus: 5 problems on integration by parts; due Friday\u201d) and I\u2019ll generate answers and step-by-step work.\n\nI can\u2019t log in with your credentials, so I\u2019ll need the content pasted or uploaded.
