To finish the homework I\u2019ll need the assignment itself. You can pick one of these options and I\u2019ll complete it right away:\n\n1. Paste the homework questions (or a screenshot) into the chat.  \n2. Upload the assignment file(s) (PDF, DOCX, images).  \n3. Give the exact assignment page URL (if it\u2019s a specific page) \u2014 if it\u2019s behind a login I won\u2019t be able to access it unless you paste the content or share files.  \n4. Tell me the course, topic, and the problems you need done (copy each problem number and text).\n\nWhen you send the assignment, indicate how you want the output (detailed step-by-step solutions, concise answers only, code files, LaTeX, etc.). I\u2019ll then complete the work and provide solutions formatted for submission."
