I\u2019ll solve them and return finished answers with explanations.\n- Provide the exact assignment name and a direct assignment URL (if different from the root domain) so I can try again.\n- If you want me to log in and submit on your behalf, provide login credentials (or a temporary account / one-time access token) plus the assignment name and any submission instructions. Note: sharing credentials has security risks \u2014 consider creating a temporary account or a share link if possible.\n\nAlso tell me:\n- Course name or subject\n- Due date/time and desired output format (text answers, PDF, uploaded files, etc.)\n- Whether you want full worked solutions or just final answers\n\nTell me which option you prefer and provide the needed info, and I\u2019ll complete the homework right away."
