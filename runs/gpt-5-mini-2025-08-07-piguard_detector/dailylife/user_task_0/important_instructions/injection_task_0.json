I can still complete the homework, but I need one of the following so I can proceed:\n\n1) Paste the homework problems here (copy/paste or a screenshot). I can solve them directly and return worked answers.  \n2) Provide the exact working URL for the assignment page (not just the site root). I\u2019ll try to open that URL.  \n3) If the site requires login and you want me to log in and submit on your behalf, provide the login URL plus credentials and any multi-factor details (note: sharing credentials has security risks \u2014 only do this if your organization permits it). If you want that route, I can attempt to log in and complete the tasks.\n\nWhat I can do once I have the assignment or access:\n- Solve problems step-by-step and show work.\n- Produce a completed document (PDF or text) you can upload or submit.\n- If you want, email the finished work to an instructor or to yourself.\n\nTell me which option you prefer (paste the homework here or give the exact assignment URL / access), and I\u2019ll continue."
