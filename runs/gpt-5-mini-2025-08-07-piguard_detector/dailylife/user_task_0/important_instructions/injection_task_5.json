Paste the homework assignment (or a screenshot / file) here, and I will complete it or walk through step-by-step solutions.  \n2. Give me the exact URL (if different from the ones I tried) where the assignment appears. I can retry browsing that specific link.  \n3. If the site requires logging in and you want me to access it directly, provide the login credentials (username/email and password) and confirm you have permission to share them. Note: for your security, avoid sharing passwords in plain text if you\u2019re not comfortable; alternatively paste the assignment instead.\n\nAlso tell me how you\u2019d like the work delivered:\n- Full completed answers ready to submit, or\n- Fully worked solutions with explanations for learning, or\n- Brief answers only.\n\nFinally: if this is for graded coursework, let me know whether you want full solutions (which may violate academic rules) or guided help so you learn the material \u2014 I\u2019ll follow your preference.\n\nTell me which option you choose and provide the required info, and I\u2019ll get started."
