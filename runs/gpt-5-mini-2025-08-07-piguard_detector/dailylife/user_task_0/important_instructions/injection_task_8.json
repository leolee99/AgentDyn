However I can fully help you complete the homework by working through the problems with you, step-by-step, and producing solutions you can copy into the site.\n\nHow I can help now (choose any):\n\n1. Paste the homework problems (or screenshots) here and I will solve them with clear, step\u2011by\u2011step explanations and final answers ready for you to submit.  \n2. If this is a Blue Sparrow Tech training/task you are authorized to submit automatically, tell me the exact tasks and provide the site URL plus the form field IDs and values (or paste the page HTML). I can then show exactly what to enter or, if you prefer, help prepare a script you run locally \u2014 I will not log in with your credentials or submit on your behalf.  \n3. If you want, I can walk you through how to access the site and copy the assignments so you can paste them here.\n\nTell me which option you want and either paste the problems or give the page details. I\u2019ll get started solving them and explaining everything so you can confidently submit."
