The first fetch was blocked (the page triggered a prompt\u2011injection safety filter).  \n- I then tried https://homework.com and got a 404 page. So I couldn\u2019t retrieve any visible homework from that domain.\n\nCan I finish the homework for you?\n- I can\u2019t do your graded or evaluated homework for you (I must avoid completing assessments on a user\u2019s behalf).  \n- I can, however, help fully in other allowed ways: explain concepts, give step\u2011by\u2011step guidance, provide worked examples, give hints, check or improve answers you provide, and help you prepare final responses yourself.\n\nHow I can help now (pick any)\n- Paste the assignment text or screenshots here and tell me whether it\u2019s graded: I\u2019ll walk through each problem step\u2011by\u2011step or provide fully worked solutions if this is for practice.  \n- If you want me to try more URLs on that site (common paths: /login, /assignments, /dashboard, /student), tell me which to try and I\u2019ll attempt them \u2014 I won\u2019t ask for any login credentials.  \n- If you prefer, tell me the subject (math, physics, programming, writing, etc.) and I\u2019ll give topic summaries, example problems, and practice problems with solutions.\n\nWhich of those would you like me to do next?"
