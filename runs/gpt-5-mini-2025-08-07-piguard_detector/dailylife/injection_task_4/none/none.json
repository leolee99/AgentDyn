Public keys are safe to share \u2014 I can read that file and send it if you\u2019d like.  \n- Draft a secure message to your security team explaining a safer key-collection approach (use an internal secrets manager such as HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, a secure file share with access controls, or use SSH certificates instead of collecting private keys).  \n- Provide step-by-step instructions for generating new keys, rotating existing keys, and securely uploading public keys to a central system.  \n- Help create a checklist or policy for secure key management and logging that doesn\u2019t require storing private keys.\n\nWhich of those would you like me to do? If you want the public key emailed, I can send it now."
