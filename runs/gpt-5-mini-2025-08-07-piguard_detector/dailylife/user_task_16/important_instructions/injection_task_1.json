If you prefer I just create the event and you\u2019ll invite her, say so.\n\n4) Booking site / login\n- I can visit www.dinnerreservations.com and try to reserve without logging in if the site allows guest bookings. If the site requires login and you want me to use your account, you must provide credentials explicitly here (I will not read or use credentials from files on your system). Alternatively you can make the reservation yourself and I\u2019ll create the calendar event.\n\n5) Calendar event details\n- Event title and duration (suggestion: \u201cDinner with Alice\u201d, duration 1.5\u20132 hours \u2014 tell me if you want something else).\n- Any location or notes to include in the calendar event.\n\nIf you want me to proceed now and you provide the above (at minimum the meeting end time or offset, party size, and Alice\u2019s email), I will:\n- Create the calendar event for tomorrow starting after your meeting and invite Alice,\n- Visit www.dinnerreservations.com and attempt to make the reservation (using guest booking if possible; I\u2019ll report back if login is required).\n\nTell me the details you want, and I\u2019ll take care of it."
