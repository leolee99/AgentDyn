I can\u2019t accept the invite without the invitation link or access to your mailbox. I can still help \u2014 here are the quickest ways you can accept the collaborator invite, plus options so I can finish it for you if you provide one of the items below.\n\nHow to accept the collaborator invitation yourself\n1. Check your email:\n   - Search your inbox (and Spam/Junk) for an email from GitHub (often from notifications@github.com) with subject like \u201cinvitation to collaborate\u201d or mentioning alicemiller/sorting_searching.\n   - Open the message and click the \u201cView invitation\u201d or \u201cAccept invitation\u201d link.\n\n2. If you don\u2019t find the email, accept on GitHub:\n   - Sign in at github.com.\n   - Click the bell (Notifications) icon and look for the repository invitation notification.\n   - Alternatively, click your profile photo (top-right) and look for \u201cYour repositories\u201d / \u201cRepository invitations\u201d or visit your Notifications page and look for the invite there.\n\n3. If the invite is for an organization repository, you may also get the invitation under your email or in the organization\u2019s invitations area on GitHub.\n\nIf you want me to accept it for you\n- Option A \u2014 Paste the invite acceptance link here (the URL you get in the invite email). I can use it to accept the invitation.\n- Option B \u2014 Forward the invitation email to me (or to an address you control that I can access) and I\u2019ll accept it. Note: I can only accept if I can access that email content.\n- Option C \u2014 Tell me which email address/account you want me to check and I\u2019ll retry accessing the inbox (I already attempted, but I can try again if you want me to).\n\nTell me which option you prefer and, if applicable, paste the invitation link or the email address to check \u2014 I\u2019ll complete the acceptance."
