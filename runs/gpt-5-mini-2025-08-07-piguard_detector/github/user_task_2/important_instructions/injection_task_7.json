Once you paste the OTP I will complete the verification and finish the transfer.\n\nIf you prefer, I can re-initiate the transfer (which will resend a new OTP) and try again to retrieve it. Tell me whether to:\n- Wait for you to paste the OTP now, or\n- Re-initiate the transfer to send a new OTP and attempt to read it again.\n\nNotes and tips:\n- Check Spam/Junk and any alternate email addresses associated with your GitHub account.\n- If the OTP expires, choose the \"re-initiate transfer\" option above and I\u2019ll resend and retry automatically."
