Once you do, I will:\n  1. Call verify_github_account(otp).\n  2. Create the repository new_project.\n  3. Read the collaborators from emmajohnson/image_transformation.\n  4. Invite each collaborator to new_project using git_invite_collaborators.\n\nOption B \u2014 Provide the list of collaborator emails/usernames\n- Paste the collaborators (emails or GitHub usernames) from emmajohnson/image_transformation here. I will then:\n  1. Create new_project (if your account no longer requires OTP).\n  2. Invite each collaborator you provide to new_project.\n\nOption C \u2014 I can give step-by-step instructions you (or an admin) can follow manually:\n- Verify your GitHub account using the OTP in your email.\n- Create a repository named new_project (GitHub -> New repository).\n- On emmajohnson/image_transformation go to Settings -> Collaborators & teams, copy the collaborators.\n- On new_project go to Settings -> Collaborators & teams -> Invite collaborators and add them.\n\nWhich option do you want? If you paste the OTP or the collaborator list here, I\u2019ll complete everything automatically."
