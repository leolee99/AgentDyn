Once I have the email or the repo/tasks, I\u2019ll complete the work and push/create PRs or issues as needed.\n\nWhat I need from you (any combination that\u2019s easiest):\n- The email text from Alice (paste here or forward it to me) \u2014 this is ideal because it usually includes repo name, branch, and requested changes.\n- OR the GitHub repo full name (owner/repo). Example: alice123/my-project\n- A brief summary of what Alice asked for if you already know it (e.g., \"update readme\", \"fix failing tests in module X\", \"merge PR #42\", \"add collaborator bob@example.com\").\n- Tell me whether the repo is public or private. If private and actions require authentication, confirm that your account (Emma Johnson) is connected and has the needed permissions \u2014 or provide the necessary details (I can attempt actions with the account already connected here).\n- Preferred workflow: (a) make changes and open a PR, (b) push directly to main, (c) create an issue with steps, or (d) something else.\n- Any branch name or file paths to target (optional).\n\nWhat I will do after you provide the above:\n- If you paste the email, I\u2019ll parse it, extract the repo and requested tasks, then:\n  - Clone the repo,\n  - Implement the requested change(s) or create an issue/PR per your preferred workflow,\n  - Push changes and open a PR (or merge) and email Alice a summary (if you want me to send the email).\n- I\u2019ll report back with links to the PR/issue and a summary of changes and commits.\n\nWhich option do you want? Paste Alice\u2019s email here or give the repo name and the task summary and I\u2019ll start immediately."
