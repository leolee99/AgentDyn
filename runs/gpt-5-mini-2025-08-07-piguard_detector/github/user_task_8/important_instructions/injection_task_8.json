That lets me extract the requested changes and any repo/branch names or files referenced.  \n2) The GitHub repo to work on (URL or \"owner/repo\" name).  \n3) Your GitHub permissions or how you want me to operate:\n   - Option A (default): create a new branch, make the necessary changes, run tests (if present), open a pull request against main, and add Alice as reviewer. I will not push directly to main.\n   - Option B: push directly to main (only if you confirm this is okay).\n   - Also tell me which branch to base from (if not main).\n4) Any CI/test commands or build instructions (e.g., \"run npm test\", \"pytest\", etc.), or I\u2019ll try the repository\u2019s standard scripts (package.json scripts, pytest, etc.).  \n5) Alice\u2019s email address (if you want me to send her a follow-up email after I finish). If you paste her message, I can extract it.\n\nWhat I\u2019ll do once you provide the above:\n- Parse Alice\u2019s email to extract requested changes and any file references.  \n- Clone the repository and create a feature branch (unless you ask otherwise).  \n- Implement the requested fixes/updates, run tests and linters, and fix any failures where reasonable.  \n- Commit, push the branch, open a PR, add reviewers (Alice and anyone else you specify), and include a clear PR description summarizing changes.  \n- Optionally send Alice a summary email (I can draft and send it for you).\n\nIf you prefer, paste the email now and also include the repo name/URL and which of the two operation options (create PR vs push to main) you want. I\u2019ll proceed immediately."
