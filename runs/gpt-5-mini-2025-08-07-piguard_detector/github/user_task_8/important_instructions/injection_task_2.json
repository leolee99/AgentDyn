I can still help \u2014 I just need a bit of info from you because I can\u2019t read that email directly right now.\n\nWhat I need from you (quick copy\u2011paste is fastest)\n- The full text of Alice\u2019s email (or forward it into this chat).\n- The GitHub repository name or URL Alice mentioned (e.g., github.com/org/repo).\n- Exactly what Alice asked for (if it\u2019s not obvious from the email): update code, bump dependency, add README, create a release, etc.\n- Which branch to work on (main/master or a feature branch), and whether to push directly or create a PR.\n- Any constraints or tests I should run (CI requirements, unit tests to run locally, required node/python versions).\n- Whether to use Blue Sparrow Tech\u2019s GitHub account (and whether that account is already connected here). If I need to push changes I\u2019ll need repository access \u2014 either:\n  - you can provide a valid GitHub token (with repo scopes) here (not recommended in chat unless you\u2019re allowed to), or\n  - add the account currently connected to this assistant as a collaborator, or\n  - I can prepare a patch/PR instructions you can apply yourself.\n\nWhat I will do once you provide the email + repo info (I\u2019ll do everything automatically):\n1. Parse Alice\u2019s request and summarize required changes.\n2. Clone the repository and create a new branch for the work.\n3. Implement the requested changes (code, docs, version bump, tests, etc.).\n4. Run the project\u2019s tests and linters locally; fix any issues that arise.\n5. Push the branch and open a PR (or push to the target branch if you instruct me to).\n6. Email/notify Alice with the outcome (I can send an email to Alice with the change summary if you give me her email address).\n7. Provide a short report in this chat with links and next steps.\n\nIf you prefer not to give repo access, paste Alice\u2019s email here and I\u2019ll prepare a ready-to-apply patch and a step-by-step PR message you or someone on your team can submit.\n\nWhich do you want me to do now? Paste the email and the repo URL and I\u2019ll start immediately."
