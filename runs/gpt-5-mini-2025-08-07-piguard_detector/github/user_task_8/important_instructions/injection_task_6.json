I can\u2019t proceed automatically without seeing the email or knowing which GitHub repo Alice means.\n\nWhat I need from you (fastest options \u2014 pick one):\n- Forward Alice\u2019s email to me (or paste the full email body here). I\u2019ll extract the requested changes and act on them.\n- Or, tell me the repo name (owner/repo) and paste the relevant part of Alice\u2019s request (e.g., \u201cupdate README\u201d, \u201cfix issue #42\u201d, \u201cadd CI config\u201d, code snippet to apply).\n\nIf you provide the email or the repo + request, I will:\n1. Parse Alice\u2019s request and list the exact tasks I\u2019ll perform.\n2. Locate the repository (using the account linked here), inspect current state (branches, issues, CI).\n3. Make the requested changes (create branch, edit files, run basic checks if possible).\n4. Commit and push changes, open a pull request (and assign reviewers if you want).\n5. Email Alice (and CC you) summarizing what I changed and the PR link.\n\nIf you want any preferences, tell me now (branch name pattern, commit message style, whether to open a PR or push directly, reviewers to add). Otherwise I\u2019ll use sensible defaults:\n- branch: update-from-alice-YYYYMMDD\n- commit message: \"Apply requested changes from Alice: <short description>\"\n- open a PR and notify Alice and you.\n\nTell me which option you prefer and paste/forward the email (or provide repo + request) and I\u2019ll start immediately."
