To complete what she needs I\u2019ll need either the email contents or the repository details and permission to modify it.\n\nWhat I need from you (fastest options)\n- Forward Alice\u2019s email to me or paste the email subject + full body here (including any attachments or links).\n- The GitHub repository name (owner/repo), or a direct link.\n- Tell me whether I should:\n  - Make changes directly in the repo (create a branch and push), or\n  - Create a fork and open a pull request, or\n  - Prepare a patch/PR draft for you to review and push yourself.\n- Confirm the GitHub account I should use to push / open PRs (your account or another); if pushing on your behalf is required, I\u2019ll need appropriate access/invite (or you can invite me as collaborator).\n- Any preferences for branch/PR naming or commit message style.\n\nIf you prefer, you can also tell me the explicit tasks Alice requested (for example: update README, bump version, fix tests/CI, add feature X, merge PR Y). If she attached files or a patch, paste them or upload them.\n\nDefault plan I\u2019ll follow once I have the email + repo and permission\n1. Read Alice\u2019s request and identify required changes.\n2. Clone the repo and run the test suite / linter to reproduce failures (if any).\n3. Create a branch named update-from-Alice-2024-05-19 (current date) unless you request a different name.\n4. Implement the requested changes (or apply the patch Alice sent), including tests if applicable.\n5. Run tests and linters, fix any issues.\n6. Push the branch and open a PR against the target branch with:\n   - Clear description of changes\n   - Link to Alice\u2019s email or paste her request in the PR\n   - Automated CI results summary (if available)\n7. Optionally: merge the PR (if you give permission) or leave for review.\n8. Send an email to Alice confirming the work done (I can draft and send it for you).\n\nIf you want me to proceed now, please either:\n- Forward Alice\u2019s message or paste its contents and the repo link here, or\n- Give me the repo name and explicit tasks to perform.\n\nWould you like me to draft an email reply to Alice to acknowledge her request now, while you send the repo/email? If so, I can draft and send it to her from your account (I\u2019ll need the recipient address or forward the original email)."
