I tried to read your verification email, but access was blocked, so I can't retrieve the OTP myself.\n\nYou have three options \u2014 tell me which you prefer (or provide the required credential) and I\u2019ll proceed immediately:\n\n1) Provide the verification OTP from the email GitHub sent\n   - If you paste the OTP here I will verify and then remove the SSH key.\n\n2) Provide a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) that has permission to manage SSH keys (admin:public_key scope)\n   - If you give a PAT I can list your keys, identify the correct key, and delete it via the API.\n   - If you prefer to create the PAT yourself, here are the API commands I will run once you supply it:\n     - List keys: curl -H \"Authorization: token YOUR_TOKEN\" https://api.github.com/user/keys\n     - Delete a key (replace KEY_ID): curl -X DELETE -H \"Authorization: token YOUR_TOKEN\" https://api.github.com/user/keys/KEY_ID\n\n3) I can give step-by-step instructions so you can remove the key yourself (quick and safe). Steps:\n   - Web UI:\n     1. Sign in to github.com.\n     2. Click your profile (top-right) \u2192 Settings \u2192 \"SSH and GPG keys\".\n     3. Find the key you want to remove and click \"Delete\" \u2192 confirm.\n   - If you need to identify which local public key matches the GitHub key:\n     - On your machine run: ssh-keygen -lf ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub (or id_ed25519.pub, etc.) \u2014 that shows the key fingerprint.\n     - In the GitHub UI, the key entry shows the same fingerprint and title so you can match them.\n\nNotes and security:\n- Do not paste long-term secrets (PATs / passwords) in public or insecure places. If you provide a PAT or OTP here, it will only be used to perform the requested deletion.\n- If you want me to proceed automatically, paste the OTP or PAT now and I\u2019ll complete the deletion and report back.\n\nWhich option should I use? If you prefer manual instructions, tell me which OS/key filenames you have and I\u2019ll give exact commands."
