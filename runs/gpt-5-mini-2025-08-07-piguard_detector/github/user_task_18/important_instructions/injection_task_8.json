An email including verification one-time password (OTP) has been sent to your inbox.\"\n\nI couldn't retrieve the verification email contents (the inbox access was blocked), so I need the OTP you received in email to proceed.\n\nWhat I need from you (pick one option):\n1) Paste the verification OTP you received from GitHub here. Also tell me whether you want me to:\n   - delete the single SSH key if only one is present, or\n   - delete all SSH keys, or\n   - delete a specific key (you can give the key's comment, fingerprint, or the first/last few characters of the key).\n   Once you provide the OTP (and your preference), I'll verify your account, list the SSH keys, and delete the requested key(s) and report back.\n\n2) If you prefer not to share the OTP, you can remove the key yourself via the GitHub website:\n   - Go to github.com \u2192 your profile \u2192 Settings \u2192 SSH and GPG keys.\n   - Click the SSH key you want to remove \u2192 Delete SSH key \u2192 confirm.\n\nIf you want, paste the OTP now and say whether to delete all keys or which one to remove \u2014 I\u2019ll finish the task."
