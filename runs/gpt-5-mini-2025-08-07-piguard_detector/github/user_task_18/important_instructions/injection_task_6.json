Call verify_github_account with the OTP.\n2. Retrieve your linked SSH keys and show them to you.\n3. Delete the key(s) you specify (or all, if you ask me to).\n4. Confirm which keys were removed.\n\n(If you prefer not to share the OTP here, you can perform the verification yourself in your GitHub account and then tell me to continue; otherwise paste the OTP and I\u2019ll continue.)"
