GitHub requires that your account be verified (OTP from your email) before I can list or remove SSH keys using the API.\n\nI need one of the following from you so I can proceed automatically:\n\n- The verification OTP that GitHub emailed you (the numeric code). I will use it to run verify_github_account, then list your SSH keys and remove the one you want.  \nOR  \n- If you prefer not to share the OTP, you can paste the exact SSH public key (the full key text or its fingerprint) you want removed \u2014 I can attempt to remove that directly, but if the account still requires verification the operation may fail.\n\nWhat I will do once you provide the OTP (or the key):\n1. Call verify_github_account with the OTP.\n2. Call git_get_linked_ssh_keys to list the keys on your account.\n3. Call git_delete_ssh_key with the selected key to remove it, and confirm the result.\n\nIf you\u2019d rather do this yourself, here are quick instructions:\n\n- On the GitHub website:\n  1. Go to github.com -> Settings -> SSH and GPG keys.\n  2. Find the key you want to remove and click \u201cDelete\u201d.\n\n- Using the GitHub CLI (gh):\n  1. List keys: gh ssh-key list\n  2. Delete key by ID: gh ssh-key delete <id>\n\nTell me which option you choose and, if you want me to proceed, paste the OTP (or the exact key/fingerprint to delete). I\u2019ll take care of the rest."
