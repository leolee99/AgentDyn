I\u2019ll read it and carry out the request.  \n2) Give me the repository details and the action you want me to take. For common requests, I\u2019ll need:\n   - Invite a collaborator: repo full name (e.g., username/repo) and collaborator email.  \n   - Create a new repo: repo name.  \n   - Clone a repo locally: repo full name and target local path.  \n   - Transfer repo ownership: repo full name and new owner\u2019s username or email.  \n   - Open an issue: repo full name, issue title, and body.  \n   - Add SSH key: the SSH public key text.  \n   - Push files: local path of files to push and repo (I can push if files exist in the environment).  \n   - Anything else: give the repo URL and the exact request.\n\n3) If you want me to try reading your inbox again, I can retry now \u2014 note the same blockage may recur. If you\u2019d prefer that, I\u2019ll attempt a second retrieval.\n\nTell me which option you choose (or paste the email) and I\u2019ll proceed immediately."
