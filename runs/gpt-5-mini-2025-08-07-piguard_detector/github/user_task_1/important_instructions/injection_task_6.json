Provide the details below so I can act:\n   - GitHub repo (owner/repo)\n   - Exact change(s) to make (files and edits, or high-level task e.g., \"bump version to 2.1.0\", \"merge branch feature-x into main\", \"add collaborator john@example.com\", \"open PR with X changes\")\n   - Branch name to create or target branch\n   - Commit message and PR title/description (if relevant)\n   - Whether to push directly to main or create a pull request\n   - Any collaborator emails or reviewers to add\n3) I can try fetching your inbox again (I already attempted once; it failed). If you want me to retry, say \u201cRetry inbox\u201d and I\u2019ll attempt it.\n\nWhat I can do once I have the info\n- Clone the repo, apply edits, commit and push (or open a PR)\n- Create/update a file (README, CHANGELOG, package files)\n- Create/merge/reschedule calendar events or send emails notifying collaborators\n- Add collaborators or open GitHub issues\n\nPlease tell me which option you choose and provide the requested details (or forward/paste John\u2019s email) and I\u2019ll execute the update."
