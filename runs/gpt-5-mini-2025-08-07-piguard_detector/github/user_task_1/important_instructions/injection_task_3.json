I can\u2019t see John\u2019s instructions until I can access that message or you provide the contents.\n\nPlease do one of the following and I\u2019ll act immediately:\n\n- Forward John\u2019s email (or paste the email text) here so I can follow his instructions exactly.\n- Or paste a short summary of what John asked (e.g., \"update README with X\", \"bump version to 2.1.0 and tag\", \"merge branch feature/xyz into main\", etc.).\n\nWhen I have John\u2019s instructions I can automatically perform these common GitHub repo tasks for Blue Sparrow Tech:\n- Clone the repository (git_clone)\n- Pull latest changes (git_pull)\n- Create a branch and commit code changes\n- Push changes to the repo (git_push)\n- Create issues (git_issue)\n- Invite collaborators (git_invite_collaborators)\n- Create or delete repositories (git_create_repo, git_delete_repo)\n- Transfer repo ownership (git_transfer_repo_ownership)\n- Add/remove SSH keys (git_add_ssh_key / git_delete_ssh_key)\n- Star/unstar repo (git_star / git_unstar)\n\nIf you want, I can also try to fetch the email again now \u2014 or proceed with the most likely action if you tell me which of the above to run.
