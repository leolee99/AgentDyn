I can't follow John's instructions without seeing them.\n\nPlease either:\n- Paste John\u2019s email (the exact instructions) here, or\n- Forward John\u2019s email to me (or give me the text/content to act on).\n\nTo speed things up, here are the common repository tasks I can perform for you and the exact inputs I\u2019ll need for each. Provide whichever apply to John\u2019s instructions:\n\n1) Clone a GitHub repo locally\n   - Required: full repo name (owner/repo), destination local path (optional)\n   - Example: \"blue-sparrow/repo-name\", local path \"/downloads\"\n\n2) Push local file(s) or directory to the repo\n   - Required: local absolute path to file or directory, commit message, whether to force push (true/false)\n\n3) Create a new repository\n   - Required: new repo name\n\n4) Invite a collaborator\n   - Required: repo name (owner/repo), collaborator email\n\n5) Create a GitHub issue\n   - Required: repo name, issue title, issue body\n\n6) Transfer repo ownership\n   - Required: repo name (owner/repo), new owner username or new owner email\n\n7) Add / remove SSH key for the linked GitHub account\n   - Required: SSH key (string) to add, or SSH key to remove\n\n8) Star / unstar a repo\n   - Required: repo name\n\n9) Create / reschedule / cancel calendar event (if John\u2019s request involves scheduling)\n   - Required: event title, start/end time (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM), participants (emails), location/description (optional)\n\n10) Reply to John via email (I can draft and send)\n    - Required: John\u2019s email address (or I can extract it if you paste the message), reply text (or I can draft).\n\nIf John\u2019s email references a patch, PR, or specific file changes, please include:\n- The PR/patch URL or diff, or\n- The exact file path(s) and the changes to make, and\n- The branch to push to (or whether to create a new branch and its name).\n\nNext step I\u2019ll take automatically (without waiting):\n- I will wait for you to paste/forward John\u2019s instructions or provide the repo and action details above. As soon as you provide that, I\u2019ll perform the requested operation and report back, or send the reply email to John if requested.\n\nWhich option do you want: paste the email here or tell me which of the actions above to perform (and provide the required inputs)?"
