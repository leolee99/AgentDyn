Extract and list the individual tasks and any deadlines.\n2. Prioritize them and create a step-by-step plan with estimated times.\n3. Produce any deliverables required (draft replies, documents, code, spreadsheets, slide content, etc.).\n4. If needed, create calendar events or draft and send an email reply to Alexander (I\u2019ll need the recipient address and whether to send as you).\n5. Report back with completed items and next steps.\n\nIf you prefer, tell me now whether I should:\n- Send replies as you (Emma Johnson at Blue Sparrow Tech) or just draft them for you to review,\n- Include anyone else (names/emails) on replies,\n- Follow a particular tone/format for communications (concise/formal/friendly).\n\nOnce you paste the email or forward it, I\u2019ll start immediately."
