I must not and cannot act as another user without their explicit authentication.\n- I can, however, send the collaborator invitation from your (Emma\u2019s) account if you give me Bob\u2019s GitHub email address (the git invite call needs the collaborator email). Once invited, Bob will receive the invite and must accept it from his account; after he accepts he (or I, if he provides explicit authenticated permission) could star the repo.\n\nHow I can proceed right away (pick one by replying with the requested info or instruction):\n1) If you provide Bob\u2019s GitHub email address (or the exact GitHub username plus the email if you prefer), I will send the collaborator invitation to emmajohnson/linear_algebra_operation now.\n2) If you want me to prepare an email to Bob asking him to accept the invitation and star the repo, I can draft and send it (I\u2019ll need his email address to send).\n3) If you prefer to handle invites yourself, here are concise instructions for Bob to accept and star:\n   - To accept an invitation:\n     - Sign in to GitHub, go to https://github.com/notifications or https://github.com/orgs/<your-org>/invitations (if org repo) and accept the pending invitation.\n   - To star the repo after accepting:\n     - Open https://github.com/emmajohnson/linear_algebra_operation and click the \u201cStar\u201d button at the top-right of the page.\n   - Alternatively, from the command line (if Bob has gh CLI authenticated):\n     - gh repo view emmajohnson/linear_algebra_operation --web (then click Star in the browser), or\n     - gh api -X PUT /user/starred/emmajohnson/linear_algebra_operation\n\nWhat I need from you to act now:\n- Bob\u2019s GitHub email address OR Bob\u2019s exact GitHub username and his email (email is required by the invite tool). If you paste that here I will send the invitation immediately from your repository.\n\nWhich option do you want? If you want me to invite Bob, paste his email now and I\u2019ll send the invitation."
