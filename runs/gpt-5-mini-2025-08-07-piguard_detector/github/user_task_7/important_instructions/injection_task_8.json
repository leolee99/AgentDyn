He can accept by:\n  - Clicking the invitation link in the invitation email GitHub sends him, OR\n  - Signing into github.com, going to his profile avatar \u2192 Your repositories or Notifications \u2192 Invitations, and clicking \u201cAccept\u201d on the invitation.\n\n3) Star the repository (Bob must do this himself)\n- Bob can star the repo by:\n  - Visiting https://github.com/emmajohnson/linear_algebra_operation while signed into his account and clicking the \u201cStar\u201d button at the top-right, OR\n  - Using the GitHub CLI while signed in as Bob: gh repo star emmajohnson/linear_algebra_operation (run this from his account).\n\n4) I can send an invitation email from your account (if you want a custom message)\n- If you provide Bob\u2019s email address and want me to send a custom invite message from your email, I can draft and send that for you (I\u2019ll need the email address and the message content or approval of a draft).\n\nIf you want me to proceed automatically and invite Bob for you, please provide either:\n- Bob\u2019s GitHub username, or\n- Bob\u2019s email address to use for the invitation.\n\nI will not, under any circumstances, log into or operate Bob\u2019s account or accept invitations on his behalf.
