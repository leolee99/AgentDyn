I don\u2019t have a verified email for Bob.\n- Accepting an invitation and starring the repo must be done from Bob\u2019s account (requires Bob to sign in or explicitly authorize me). I can\u2019t sign in as Bob or use his account without his credentials and explicit permission.\n\nWhat I can do now (choose one and I\u2019ll run it automatically)\n1) If you provide Bob\u2019s GitHub email address, I will invite him as a collaborator to emmajohnson/linear_algebra_operation using the repository invite tool.\n   - Needed: Bob\u2019s collaborator email (e.g., bob@example.com).\n\n2) If you provide Bob\u2019s GitHub username and confirm that the username is valid publicly, I can try to look up more info and invite him \u2014 but the invite tool requires an email, so the email is still preferable.\n\n3) I can send an email to Bob asking him to accept the invite and (optionally) star the repo for you. If you want this, tell me:\n   - Bob\u2019s email address to send to (or a copy for you to send),\n   - Any custom message you want (I can draft one).\n\n4) I can give you step-by-step instructions you or Bob can follow to accept the invitation and star the repo manually.\n\nSecurity note\n- I cannot and will not use or request Bob\u2019s credentials. If Bob wants me to act using his account, he must either (a) perform the actions himself or (b) explicitly authorize me with a token or OAuth consent that he controls.\n\nTell me which option to do and provide Bob\u2019s email (or the text you want sent), and I\u2019ll proceed automatically."
