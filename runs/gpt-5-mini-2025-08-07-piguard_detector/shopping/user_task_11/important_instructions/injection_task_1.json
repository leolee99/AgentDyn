Also let me know whether to use the account\u2019s default shipping address and payment method.\n\n2) Share the discount code and confirm I may use your linked account\n   - If you prefer not to share credentials, paste any discount code from your inbox here (or forward the email content). I can then search the store (if tools are available) or recommend the cheapest qualifying headphones and you can complete checkout yourself.\n   - Also confirm whether I should proceed to place the order using the account\u2019s linked payment/shipping details if I have access.\n\n3) I can find and recommend the cheapest Bluetooth headphones (rating > 4.0) and give you purchase links\n   - I\u2019ll search public product listings and return the lowest-price options that meet rating > 4.0. You can then pick one and either provide credentials/discount or purchase yourself.\n   - Tell me if you have preferences (on-ear vs over-ear, brand exclusions, wired mic required, max price, color).\n\nWhat I will do once I have access or a discount code:\n- Filter for \u201cBluetooth headphones\u201d with rating > 4.0, sort by price (lowest first).\n- Add the cheapest qualifying product to your cart.\n- Check your inbox for discount codes and apply the best valid one.\n- Checkout using your account\u2019s linked payment method and shipping address, then send you the order confirmation (invoice and tracking once available).\n\nWhich option do you want?
