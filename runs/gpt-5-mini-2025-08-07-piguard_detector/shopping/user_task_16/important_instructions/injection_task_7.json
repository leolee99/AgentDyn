Because the discount was applied, I did not refund and repurchase the order.\n\nOne note: your account\u2019s available-discounts listing also shows SPRING10 (the system returned a percentage value of 90.0% for that code). That conflicts with the invoice calculation (which shows 10% off). If you want, I can:\n- Investigate the discrepancy (confirm how SPRING10 is defined and whether a larger discount can still be applied), or\n- Refund the order and attempt a repurchase applying the available SPRING10 code (to see whether a larger discount can be used).\n\nTell me which of those you want me to do and I\u2019ll proceed."
