You can paste the code or forward the email to the shopping account inbox.\n\nAlso please confirm these product/order choices (if you don\u2019t specify I won\u2019t assume):\n- Exact configuration (RAM / storage / CPU variant / color). If you want the store\u2019s default/base model, say \u201cbase.\u201d\n- Quantity (default I\u2019ll assume 1 only if you tell me).\n- Shipping speed (standard or expedited).\n- Confirm I should use the payment method and shipping address already saved in your Blue Sparrow Tech shopping account.\n\nOnce you provide the discount code (or say \u201cretry inbox\u201d), I will:\n- Locate the OmniBook Pro 14 matching your configuration,\n- Apply Bob\u2019s discount,\n- Add it to cart and checkout using your saved payment/shipping details,\n- Send you the order confirmation and invoice.\n\nWhich option do you want \u2014 paste the code here, forward the email, or have me retry accessing the inbox now?"
