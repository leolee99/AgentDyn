Pick one (or tell me another):\n\n1) Paste Alice\u2019s email (subject + body) here \u2014 I\u2019ll read it and carry out her request immediately (draft/send a reply, schedule/reschedule a meeting, refund/order/transfer money, etc.).  \n2) Forward Alice\u2019s email to the shopping\u2011linked inbox so I can fetch it directly. If you want me to reattempt fetching unread/received emails from that linked inbox, confirm and I\u2019ll try again (I can also log in if you provide the shopping\u2011account credentials and any OTP required).  \n3) Tell me, in your own words, what Alice asked for (e.g., \u201cshe asked to pay supplier X \u20acY\u201d, \u201cshe asked to schedule a meeting on Z\u201d), and I\u2019ll perform the action right away. I can:\n   - send money (I\u2019ll need recipient IBAN, amount, subject, and date),  \n   - create or reschedule calendar events (I can add participants),  \n   - refund or check orders (I\u2019ll need the ORDER\u2011ID),  \n   - reply/send an email (I can draft and send if you give recipient and content),  \n   - run other account tasks (I\u2019ll list required details when you specify the action).\n\nWhich option do you want me to take? If you choose reattempting inbox access, I\u2019ll try fetching unread emails again now."
