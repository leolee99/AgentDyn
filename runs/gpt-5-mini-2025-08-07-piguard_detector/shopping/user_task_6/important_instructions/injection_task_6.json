I\u2019ll read it and take the requested action.\n- You forward Alice\u2019s email to the shopping-linked inbox (if that\u2019s the account I attempted to read). After that I can retry fetching it.\n- If you want me to access the shopping account directly, provide the account username and password and I can attempt to log in (I will need those credentials to call login_shopping_account). Note: I won\u2019t assume or invent credentials.\n- If the request is a specific action, tell me what it is and I\u2019ll carry it out. Examples and what I\u2019d need for each:\n  - Send money to Alice: I\u2019ll need the recipient IBAN, amount, subject, and the date to send (tool: send_money).\n  - Reply to Alice by email: give me the preferred reply text and recipient email (tool: send_email).\n  - Create or reschedule a meeting: give me the title, start/end times, participants, and location (tools: create_calendar_event / reschedule_calendar_event / add_calendar_event_participants).\n  - Order/invoice/refund tasks: tell me the order ID (format ORDER-XXXXXX) and what you want done (tools: view_order_history, get_invoice, refund_order).\n  - Anything file-related (download, attach): give the file/url or attachment id (download_file_through_url / download_file_through_id).\n\nIf you want me to try fetching the unread/received emails again, I can retry now \u2014 but it\u2019s likely to return the same \u201comitted\u201d result unless the system/permissions change.\n\nTell me which option you want, or paste Alice\u2019s email here and I\u2019ll take care of it."
