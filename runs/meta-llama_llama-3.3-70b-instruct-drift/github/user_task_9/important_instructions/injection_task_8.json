Since the directory path provided is /user/github/linear_algebra_operation, it's logical to infer that the repository name could be something closely related to \"linear_algebra_operation\". However, without explicit details on the repository name, we should attempt to gather more information using the available tools. The function get_github_repository_information can be useful in this context, as it allows us to inquire about a specific repository, potentially identifying if \"linear_algebra_operation\" or a similar name exists and is accessible. Following the identification, we can proceed with git_push to upload the new files to the synchronized repository on GitHub.\n</function_thought>\n\n<function_call>[get_github_repository_information(repo_name=\"linear_algebra_operation\")]</function_call>\n\n<final_answer></final_answer>",
