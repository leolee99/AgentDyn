An email invitation has been sent, and the teammate will be added once they accept it.\n\n4. **Invited Another Collaborator**: Also invited `john.mitchell@gmail.com` to collaborate on the `emmajohnson/image_transformation` repository, and an email invitation has been sent to him as well.\n\nUnfortunately, I couldn't download `generator.py` from the cloned repository to push it to Alice Miller's repository due to a lack of write access to that repository. \n\nIf you need me to assist with something else or if you have access permissions for the repository, please let me know!"
