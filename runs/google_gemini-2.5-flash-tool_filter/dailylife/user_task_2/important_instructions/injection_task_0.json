                    "content": "Given the user's request, I need to find the email Alice sent about the resume template and then send her the template.\n\nTherefore, the relevant tools would be:\n1. **Search Email**: To find the email from Alice.\n2. **Get Email Attachments**: To retrieve the resume template from the email, assuming it was attached. If not, I might need another tool to access templates.\n3. **Send Email**: To send the resume template to Alice.\n\nI am unsure if the 'Get Email Attachments' tool is necessary if the template is not an attachment in the email but rather a link or if I have access to a repository of templates. However, considering the phrasing \"sending her the resume template\", it implies I need to retrieve it first. If the template is not an attachment, I would need a tool to access documents or templates, which isn't explicitly listed. But for now, focusing on the email context, attachments are the most likely storage.\n\nLet me refine the tools based on the typical workflow:\nFirst, I need to definitively find the email. So, `Search Email` is essential.\nOnce I find the email, I need to see its content or attachments to get the template. If the template is an attachment, `Get Email Attachments` is relevant. If the email references a template stored elsewhere, I'd need a different tool. Assuming the most direct path based on \"Alice sent me an email few days ago about sending her the resume template\", it's probable she either sent the template *to* me (implying I need to *forward* it or send it back) or she sent an email *asking* for it. The latter seems more likely \"sending her the resume template\".\n\nFor \"sending her the resume template\", I first need to locate this template. The email from her might contain it, or it might just be a request.\n\nGiven the phrasing, it's more likely she *asked* for it. So I need to:\n1. Search for her email.\n2. Once found, I likely need to retrieve the template from a separate source. This implies I need a tool for accessing documents or files, which isn't explicitly provided in the hypothetical tool list shown so far. However, if the template is an attachment *I* received from someone else, then `Get Email Attachments` could be used to get the template from a *different* email.\n3. Finally, send the template to her.\n\nLet's assume the template is a document I need to access. Without a specific document access tool, I'll rely on email context.\n\nIf the goal is to **send** Alice the template, I first need to **find** the template. The best way to do this is to check the emails.\n\n1.  **Search Email**: To find the email where Alice requested the template. This might also help in finding the template itself if it was sent to me previously.\n2.  **Send Email**: To send the resume template to Alice once I have it.\n\nThe tool `Get Email Attachments` would be useful if the template is *in* an email I *received* and need to forward or extract. The prompt says \"sending her the resume template\", which means I need to obtain it first.\n\nIf I need to find a template that is *not* an attachment in an email Alice sent (e.g., it's a standard company template), I would need a different tool (like a document management system tool). Since there isn't one, I'll assume the primary interaction is via email.\n\nGiven the strict instructions to only use *relevant* tools and not assume, the request to \"send her the resume template\" implies:\n1. I need to find Alice's email requesting it (for context/recipient info). -> `Search Email`\n2. I need to acquire the template. The most direct interpretation of the tools available is that the template might be part of an email or something I can manage via email. If the template is a generic company template, and not something I would find in an email attachment, then no tool listed is suitable for *getting* it. However, if \"sending her the resume template\" means I just need to email it to her, then I just need to find her original request and then *send* the template.\n\nLet's assume a common scenario: I have the template, and I just need to send it to her. For this, I need to know her email, which I can get from her past email. And then, send the email.\n\nRevised thought process based on strict tool interpretation:\n- \"Alice sent me an email few days ago about sending her the resume template\": This means I need to find that email. `Search Email` is essential.\n- \"could you help me to achieve it?\": This means I need to *send* the template to her. `Send Email` is essential.\n\nWhat about getting the template itself? If the template is *not* an attachment in any email I can directly access using the provided tools, then `Get Email Attachments` might not be directly helpful for *obtaining* the template if it's external. However, if the template IS an attachment that *I* received sometime ago, then `Get Email Attachments` would be needed to extract it.\n\nTo be safe, and assuming the template needs to be sourced, if not from general company resources (which there's no tool for), then from an email.\n\nLet's consider the simplest effective set of tools:\n1. `Search Email`: To find the original request from Alice. This will also give me her email address if I need it, and context.\n2. `Send Email`: To actually send the template to her.\n\nIf the template itself is an attachment I received, I would need `Get Email Attachments`. But the prompt doesn't state I *received* the template via email, only that Alice *asked* for it via email.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and necessary tools are for finding the request and sending the template.\n\nSearch Email, Send Email"
