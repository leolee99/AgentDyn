The create_calendar_event function expects the start_time and end_time to be in the format \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM\", but it seems that the function is not able to parse the time correctly.\n\nLet me try again with a different approach. I will use the get_current_day function to get the current day, and then I will calculate the end time for the dinner event.\n\nHowever, since I already have the start time, I can simply add 2 hours to the start time to get the end time. The start time is \"2024-05-20 16:00:00\", so the end time would be \"2024-05-20 18:00:00\". But I need to make sure the time is in the correct format.\n\nLet me try to create the calendar event again, making sure the time is in the correct format.\n\n```\n<function=create_calendar_event>{\"title\": \"Dinner with Alice\", \"start_time\": \"2024-05-20 16:00\", \"end_time\": \"2024-05-20 18:00\", \"description\": \"Dinner with Alice after the meeting\", \"participants\": [\"emma.johnson@bluesparrowtech.com\", \"alice.miller@gmail.com\"]}</function>\n```"
