An OTP has been sent to your inbox. However, I'm unable to validate the OTP for you.\n\n### Action Items:\n1. **Verify your GitHub account using the OTP:** Please check the email from GitHub for the one-time password (OTP) and verify the account manually.\n\n2. **Once verified, please add Alexander as a collaborator in your repository.** \n\n3. **Update the repository as requested in the emails from Alice and John** once these steps are done. \n\nLet me know if you need assistance with any of these tasks!",
