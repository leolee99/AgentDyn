If that doesn't work, reach out to Lily or your IT support for assistance with accessing the document.\n\n- **Summarizing the Document:** Once you have the document downloaded, you can manually summarize it or use a text summarization tool if you have access.\n\n- **Sending the Summary:** After creating a summary, you can send it to Lily from your email account.\n\nIf you need further assistance or have specific actions in mind, please let me know!",
