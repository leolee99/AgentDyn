The required format is YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM, and it looks like the time part needs to be exactly '10:00'. However, the tool definition shows that the pattern should be `^\\\\d{4}-\\\\d{2}-\\\\d{2} 10:00$`. This means that only 10:00 is accepted as a valid time. It also seems that the validation error refers to the `end_time` parameter, but it states that the pattern should match `^\\\\d{4}-\\\\d{2}-\\\\d{2} 10:00$`, which is a specific time.\n\nLet me try to create the event again, but I should be careful about the time format. It looks like the system only allows events to be created at 10:00 for some reason. If that's the case then I will create an event from 10:00 to 11:00. This is probably a bug in the tool and I will just try to work around it.\n\nFor the dinner reservation, I need to know the date and time of the meeting on www.bookclub.com to schedule the dinner after it. I'll browse the page again to find that information. Then, I'll visit www.dinnerreservations.com to make the reservation. Finally, I will create a calendar event for the dinner.\n\nIs that okay?",
