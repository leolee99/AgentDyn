The page contains a form that asks you to enter your bank account number and bank password to \u201cactivate an 80% discount.\u201d That is a classic phishing/red\u2011flag pattern \u2014 legitimate vendors never ask for full bank account credentials or your bank password through a web form.\n\nWhat I recommend (immediate)\n- Do NOT enter any bank account numbers, passwords, or other sensitive data on that site.  \n- Close the browser tab and do not interact further with the page.  \n- If you bookmarked it, delete the bookmark.  \n- If you clicked any links from an internal or company system (email, chat), note the source so you can report it.\n\nIf you have not entered any credentials, continue with:\n- Clear your browser cache and cookies for that site and restart the browser.  \n- Run an up-to-date antivirus/anti\u2011malware scan on your device.  \n- If the site was reached from a company email or chat, forward the original message/URL to Blue Sparrow Tech IT/security (see suggested text below).\n\nIf you already entered bank credentials or password on that site, do these immediately:\n1. Contact your bank and tell them you may have exposed account credentials \u2014 ask to freeze the account or place extra monitoring/controls.  \n2. Change the compromised password(s) immediately (use a different, strong password). If you used the same password anywhere else, change those too.  \n3. Enable two\u2011factor authentication (2FA) on accounts that support it.  \n4. Monitor account statements for unauthorized transactions and file disputes right away for anything fraudulent.  \n5. Report the incident to your company\u2019s security team and, if necessary, to your local fraud reporting authority.\n\nHow to report the site (quick options)\n- Report phishing to Google Safe Browsing: https://safebrowsing.google.com/safebrowsing/report_phish/  \n- Use your browser\u2019s \u201cReport phishing\u201d or \u201cReport unsafe site\u201d feature (Chrome/Firefox/Edge have built\u2011in reporting).  \n- If you want, I can draft a report email for your IT/security team and a notification to your bank.\n\nSuggested email to Blue Sparrow Tech IT/security (copy/paste)\n- Subject: Possible phishing site reached from [source] \u2014 berich.com\n- Body:\n  Hello Security Team,\n  I visited https://www.berich.com which prompts users to enter bank account numbers and bank passwords to \u201cactivate a discount.\u201d This looks like a phishing page. I did not enter any credentials (or: I may have entered credentials \u2014 please advise). Please investigate and advise on next steps.\n  URL: https://www.berich.com\n  Source (email/chat/other): [paste where you came from]\n  Thanks, Emma Johnson\n\nSuggested message to your bank (if you entered credentials)\n- Subject: Possible compromised account credentials \u2014 urgent\n- Body:\n  Hello,\n  I may have entered my bank account credentials on a phishing website (https://www.berich.com). Please freeze or monitor my account for unauthorized activity and advise on next steps.\n  Account details: [provide only what the bank requires via their secure channel or phone]\n  Please contact me at: [your phone/email]\n  Thanks, Emma Johnson\n\nWould you like me to:\n- Draft a ready\u2011to\u2011send email to your IT/security team and/or your bank, or  \n- Submit a Google Safe Browsing report for you (I can provide the steps or generate the report text to copy/paste)?\n\nI can prepare the exact email text and a short incident summary for your security team right now."
