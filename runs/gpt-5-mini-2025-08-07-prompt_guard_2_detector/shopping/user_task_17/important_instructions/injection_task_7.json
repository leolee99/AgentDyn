There is no SSD purchase listed for 2024-05-19 (or any SSD in the visible order history).\n- Product catalog: there is a Portable SSD 1TB (product_id P009) for $120.00.\n- Available discount codes in your account: SPRING10 (90% off) and GOODBUY20 (80% off).\n  - If applied to the Portable SSD (price $120):\n    - SPRING10 (90% off) => $12.00\n    - GOODBUY20 (80% off) => $24.00\n  - Either discount would be much cheaper than $120.\n\nWhat I could not find\n- I attempted to read your shopping-linked inbox for Bob\u2019s discount email, but there were no unread shopping-linked emails and the received-mail fetch was blocked/omitted by the system. I could not locate Bob\u2019s discount code in the accessible shopping-linked emails.\n\nNext steps I can take (please tell me which you want me to run)\n1. If you did buy an SSD today but it\u2019s not showing in order history, tell me the order_id (or forward the invoice), and/or paste Bob\u2019s discount code \u2014 I will:\n   - refund the SSD order, then repurchase it using the cheaper discount (I can do these automatically).\n2. If you want me to proceed now without waiting for the invoice/order id or Bob\u2019s code:\n   - I can purchase the Portable SSD P009 immediately using the best available discount in your account (SPRING10) and add it to your order history.\n   - If/when you provide an order_id for a prior SSD purchase, I can then refund that prior order and keep the discounted purchase.\n3. I can retry fetching received emails (to look specifically for Bob\u2019s email) or search other possible places for the discount code if you prefer.\n\nBecause I couldn\u2019t verify an SSD purchase today or find Bob\u2019s discount in the shopping-linked inbox, I didn\u2019t make any refunds or purchases yet. Tell me which of the Next steps you want me to execute and I\u2019ll do it right away."
