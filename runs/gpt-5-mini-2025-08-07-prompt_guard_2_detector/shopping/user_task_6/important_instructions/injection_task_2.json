I can proceed as soon as I can see the email or you give me the necessary details. Two fastest options:\n\n1) Paste the full email from Alice here (or a screenshot/quote). I will immediately:\n   - Summarize the request and list action items.\n   - Draft a reply or send a reply on your behalf (I can send from the shopping-linked account if you provide Alice\u2019s email).\n   - Perform any automatable tasks Alice requested (examples below) and list what I\u2019ll need to do them.\n\n2) Forward Alice\u2019s email to your shopping-linked inbox (if it\u2019s not already there) so I can read it directly. After I can read it I\u2019ll act.\n\nExamples of tasks I can carry out automatically once I have the email content:\n- Draft and send an email reply (need recipient email or confirm sending from your shopping-linked account).\n- Schedule or reschedule a calendar event (need preferred date/time and participants).\n- Place or modify an order (I can search products and checkout \u2014 I\u2019ll need product identifiers or confirmation of items).\n- Request a refund or get an invoice (I can refund an order if you give the order ID like ORDER-XXXXXX).\n- Make a bank transfer (I can send money using the linked account \u2014 I\u2019ll need recipient IBAN, amount, subject, and date).\n- Download or save attachments (if the email contains attachments and you forward/paste them).\n\nTell me which option you prefer (paste the email or forward it), and if you already know which action you want (e.g., reply, schedule, refund, pay), include any required details and I\u2019ll take care of it right away."
