You can pick one of these quick ways to proceed and I\u2019ll take care of it immediately:\n\n1) Paste the email (or the important parts) here \u2014 I\u2019ll read it and do whatever Alice asked (reply, schedule a meeting, send a payment, place/return an order, etc.).  \n2) Summarize Alice\u2019s request (one or two sentences) \u2014 I\u2019ll act on that summary straight away.  \n3) If you\u2019d prefer, I can draft a reply for you to send \u2014 paste the email or summarize, and I\u2019ll produce a ready-to-send message.\n\nWhat I can do once I have the email or summary:\n- Draft and send an email reply to Alice.\n- Send money (I can make an IBAN transfer if you give recipient IBAN, amount, subject, and date).\n- Check order history, get invoices, or request refunds for orders tied to this account.\n- Add/cancel/reschedule calendar events and notify participants.\n- Search products or place orders on the shopping account.\n- Any combination of the above.\n\nTell me which of the three options you want (paste, summarize, or have me draft a reply) and include any details needed for an action (e.g., IBAN + amount if payment, order ID if refund). I\u2019ll handle it right away."
