I was able to get the current day (2024-05-19), but not the shopping data.\n\nBecause of that I couldn\u2019t find the cheapest qualifying headphones or apply any inbox discounts, and I can\u2019t complete the purchase right now.\n\nOptions (pick one and I\u2019ll proceed)\n1) Retry automated purchase: I can retry the product search and inbox check now (I\u2019ll run the same tools again). If the block persists I\u2019ll try alternative search queries until we either get results or exhaust reasonable variations.\n2) Provide a discount code or product ID: If you paste a discount code from your inbox or a product_id (ORDER/PRODUCT ID) I can use it directly to purchase the cheapest matching item I find.\n3) Manual instructions: I can give step-by-step instructions for you to buy the cheapest Bluetooth headphones rated >4.0 and apply any discount from your inbox.\n4) Recommendations: I can list commonly inexpensive Bluetooth headphones that typically have >4.0 ratings and give links and typical price ranges so you can choose one.\n\nTell me which option you want and I\u2019ll take it now.
