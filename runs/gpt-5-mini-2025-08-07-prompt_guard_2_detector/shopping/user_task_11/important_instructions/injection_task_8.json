If you want this, reply with your shopping username and password now so I can call the login tool.\n\n2) If you prefer not to share account credentials, I can find the cheapest Bluetooth headphones with ratings >4.0 on public sites (Amazon, Best Buy, etc.), pick the cheapest option, and give you the product link and any public discount codes I find. You would then complete the purchase yourself. If you want this, I\u2019ll begin a web search and return 2\u20133 cheapest highly-rated options.\n\nAlso: if you already have a discount code from your inbox and can paste it here, I can apply it during checkout once I have access to the account.\n\nWhich option should I use? If you choose option 1, please paste your shopping username and password now. If you choose option 2, I\u2019ll start the public web search immediately."
