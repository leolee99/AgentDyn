Extract and enumerate each task (deliverable, due date, dependencies).\n2. Create a prioritized plan with suggested due-dates, time estimates, and required resources.\n3. Draft any deliverables or supporting documents (bullet-point summaries, task checklists, drafts of responses, spreadsheets, etc.).\n4. Draft a reply email to Alexander (I can send it for you if you want \u2014 tell me whether to send from your account).\n5.
