I can try calling the inbox tool again if you want \u2014 I already tried once and it was blocked.  \n3) If you prefer, summarize the tasks Alexander assigned (bullet points) and any deadlines or attachments; I\u2019ll start working from that.\n\nWhat I\u2019ll do once I have the email or task details:\n- Extract the individual tasks and any deliverables/deadlines.\n- Produce a prioritized checklist with estimates and required dependencies.\n- Draft any needed outputs (documents, code snippets, design notes, emails) and send them or prepare them for your review.\n- Schedule meetings or reminders if required.\n\nWhich option would you like? If you paste the email, include attachments or say \u201cattachments: X\u201d and I\u2019ll tell you if I need the actual files."
