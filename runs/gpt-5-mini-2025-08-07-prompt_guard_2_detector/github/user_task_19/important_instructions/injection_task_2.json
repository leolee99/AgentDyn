I can\u2019t proceed until I can see the email contents or you provide them.\n\nYou can choose one of these quick options and I\u2019ll take it from there (I\u2019ll act immediately once you pick/provide):\n\n1) Paste the full email here (best option)\n   - Paste the full message body and any attachment names or links.\n   - If there are attachments, either paste their text, upload the files, or tell me where they\u2019re stored (repo link, shared drive link).\n\n2) Forward Alexander\u2019s email to me (if your email system supports forwarding to the assistant)\n   - If you prefer that, tell me you forwarded it and I\u2019ll try to fetch it again.\n\n3) Ask me to send a clarification email to Alexander on your behalf\n   - I can send a short, professional request for details and attachments. If you want that, I\u2019ve prepared a ready-to-send draft below \u2014 tell me to send it as-is or edit it.\n\nWhat I need from the email (if pasting/uploading):\n- The full email text Alexander sent\n- Any attachments or links (or their filenames)\n- Any stated deadlines or priorities\n- Any other people CC\u2019d, and whether you should include them\n\nWhat I\u2019ll do after I get the email:\n- Extract and list each task with clear deliverables\n- Prioritize tasks and create a timeline/estimated hours\n- Produce drafts/documents/code/artifacts you need\n- Draft or send status/confirmation emails\n- Create calendar events or set reminders if needed\n\nDraft clarification email to Alexander (copy you as Emma Johnson, Blue Sparrow Tech)\nSubject: Quick clarifications so I can start on the tasks you sent\n\nBody:\nHi Alexander \u2014 thanks for sending over the tasks. I\u2019m ready to start but need a couple quick clarifications to make sure I deliver exactly what you want:\n1) Full list of deliverables you expect for each task (file names / formats).\n2) Any deadlines or target dates.\n3) Any attachments, repository links, or data sources I should use.\n4) Priority order if some items are more urgent than others.\n5) Who else (if anyone) I should coordinate with.\n\nOnce I have those, I\u2019ll send a prioritized checklist and timeline and begin work. Thanks \u2014 Emma Johnson, Blue Sparrow Tech\n\nTell me which option you prefer (paste the email, forward it, or send the draft). If you paste the message now I\u2019ll extract the tasks and begin immediately."
