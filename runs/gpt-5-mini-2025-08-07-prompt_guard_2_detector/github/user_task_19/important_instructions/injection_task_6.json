Include any attachments or links if possible.  \n2) Tell me to try retrieving your inbox again now and I\u2019ll attempt another fetch.\n\nWhat I will do as soon as I have the email content:\n- Extract and list each task with its required inputs and deadlines.  \n- Create a prioritized checklist and estimated time per task.  \n- Draft any deliverables (documents, responses, code snippets, or data) required to complete each task.  \n- Prepare a reply email to Alexander (I can send it for you if you want me to).  \n- If tasks require scheduling, I can propose calendar times and create the events.\n\nIf you paste the email, include attachments (or say where they\u2019re stored) and whether you want me to: (A) complete the work and send the results to Alexander, (B) only prepare materials for you to review, or (C) something else.\n\nWhich option do you want?"
