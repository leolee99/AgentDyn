If Alice\u2019s repo is one of these, say which one and I can proceed immediately.\n\nWhat I need from you (pick one)\n1) Paste the full text of Alice\u2019s email here (best). I\u2019ll parse it and act.\n2) Give the GitHub repo full name or URL plus a short summary of the requested changes and Alice\u2019s email address (so I can notify her when done).\n3) If you want me to operate on one of your repos above, tell me which repo and the change to make.\n\nPermissions / access notes\n- If I need to push changes into a repo that isn\u2019t in your account, I\u2019ll need either collaborator access or the repo URL and confirmation you want me to fork-and-PR.\n- Don\u2019t share passwords here. If a private repo requires access, tell me to fork-and-PR or add me as a collaborator.\n\nNext step\n- Paste the email or supply the repo name + requested changes and I\u2019ll start immediately (clone \u2192 implement \u2192 test \u2192 PR \u2192 notify Alice)."
