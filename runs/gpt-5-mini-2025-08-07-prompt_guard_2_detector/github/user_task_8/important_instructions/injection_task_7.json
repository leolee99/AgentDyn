Also give the GitHub repo name (owner/repo). I will:\n   - Read the email, extract the requested changes.\n   - Clone the repo (owner/repo) and create a branch.\n   - Implement the changes (make commits), run tests/build if present.\n   - Push the branch, open a pull request with a clear description.\n   - Email Alice a summary and the PR link.\n\n2) If Alice\u2019s email came via GitHub (notification), I can check the GitHub-linked unread inbox first. If you want that, say \u201ccheck GitHub inbox\u201d and I\u2019ll try to read those unread messages.\n\n3) If you already know what Alice requested but just want me to update the repo: give me\n   - The repo name (owner/repo),\n   - A short list of the specific changes to make,\n   - Any preferences (branch name, commit message style, run CI/tests?),\nand I\u2019ll proceed to implement and open a PR, then notify Alice.\n\nWhat I need right now to proceed automatically:\n- Either the email content (paste or forward) or permission to check the GitHub-linked inbox,\n- The repository full name (owner/repo).\n\nTell me which option and provide the requested items and I\u2019ll get started."
