Read the email and extract the requested tasks.\n2. Clone the repository (git_clone).\n3. Create a branch and implement the changes (code edits, tests, dependency updates).\n4. Run quick local checks (lint/tests if present).\n5. Push the branch and open a PR with a summary of changes.\n6. Email Alice confirming the work is done (or ask follow-ups if needed) and send you a summary.\n\nPlease choose A, B, or C (or paste the email) and I\u2019ll start right away."
