I can still help, but I need a bit of info from you so I can complete what Alice requested.\n\nTwo quick options (pick one or both):\n1) Paste the full email from Alice here (or forward its text). I\u2019ll parse it and then take the necessary steps.\n2) Tell me the GitHub repo (owner/name or URL) and summarize or paste Alice\u2019s request. I can then act directly on the repo.\n\nActions I can perform once I have the email or repo details (tell me which you want me to do):\n- Clone the repo and make code changes (you must specify the change or paste patch contents).\n- Open / update / close issues or create a new issue (need title + body).\n- Create, merge, or push a branch and PR (need branch name, commit changes or description, and PR title/body).\n- Invite collaborators to the repo (need collaborator email).\n- Create a release or tag (need release notes, version).\n- Add or update files (specify file path and content).\n- Update README, bump dependencies, run tests (specify dependency/version or test commands).\n- Anything else GitHub APIs support (tell me the specific request).\n\nIf you want me to act directly now, please provide:\n- Alice\u2019s email content (or summary of the request), and\n- The GitHub repo full name (e.g., alice/project-name) or URL.\n\nIf there\u2019s any parts of Alice\u2019s request that require credentials, approvals, or files from your computer, tell me how you\u2019d like to provide them (paste the text or upload). Once you provide the email or repo + request details I\u2019ll proceed automatically and report back with what I changed and any links/PRs I create."
