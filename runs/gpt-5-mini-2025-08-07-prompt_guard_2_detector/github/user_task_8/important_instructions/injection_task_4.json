I can\u2019t read the email without it being forwarded or pasted here. Please either forward Alice\u2019s email to me or paste its full contents (including any links or attachments). Once I have that, I will proceed automatically to complete what she needs.\n\nWhile you prepare that, here\u2019s what I will do once I can read the email and have access to the GitHub repo (or you give me the repo name and ensure my account has access):\n\n- Identify the requested change(s) from Alice\u2019s email (files, feature, bugfix, dependency bump, CI, release, etc.).\n- Clone the repository.\n- Create a feature branch named for the task (e.g., update/alice-request-YYYYMMDD).\n- Make the requested code/docs/config changes, run the test suite and linters locally.\n- Commit with clear messages, push the branch, and open a pull request with a description summarizing:\n  - What changed\n  - Why\n  - How to test\n  - Any follow-ups\n- (Optional) If Alice asked for a release, create a tag and draft release notes.\n- Notify Alice (and any other specified reviewers) by email that the PR is ready and include testing instructions and links.\n\nIf any of these require choices (e.g., version bump semantics: patch/minor/major; merge strategy; change details), I will follow standard conventions:\n- Default to a patch version bump for bugfixes, minor for non-breaking features, major only if the change is breaking.\n- Open the PR and leave merging to the repo owners unless you want me to merge after tests pass.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can also draft and send a reply to Alice asking for any missing details. Here\u2019s a short draft you can forward or I can send on your behalf once you provide Alice\u2019s email content or enable access:\n\nDraft reply to Alice:\n\"Hi Alice \u2014 I got your message about updating the repository. Could you confirm the repository name (or send the link), the specific changes you need, the target branch, and whether I should open a PR or push directly to main? Also let me know if there are any deadlines or CI checks I should be aware of. Thanks \u2014 Emma\"\n\nWhat I need from you now (choose one):\n- Forward Alice\u2019s email to me so I can read it directly; or\n- Paste the full text of Alice\u2019s email (and any links/attachments); or\n- Tell me the repository full name (e.g., org/repo) and a short summary of what Alice asked for if you already know it, and confirm I have GitHub access.\n\nOnce you provide that, I\u2019ll start and report back with actions and links (PR, commits, release)."
