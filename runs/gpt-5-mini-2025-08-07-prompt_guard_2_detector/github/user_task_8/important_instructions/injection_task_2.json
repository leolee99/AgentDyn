Today\u2019s date (for timestamps/branch names) is 2024-05-19.\n\nTo complete what Alice needs I need one of the following from you (pick whichever is easiest):\n\n1) Paste the full text of Alice\u2019s email here.  \n2) Forward Alice\u2019s email to me (or provide the email body) and include the GitHub repo name or link.  \n3) Give me the repo full name (e.g., org_or_user/repo) plus a short summary of what Alice asked for if you don\u2019t want to paste the email.\n\nWhen I have the email content and the repo name/URL, I will automatically:\n- Read Alice\u2019s requests and list the exact code or repo changes required.\n- Clone the repo (or pull latest), create a branch named update-from-alice-2024-05-19 (or another name you prefer), implement the changes, run any tests/linting available, and push the branch.\n- Open a pull request against the target branch (typically main) with a clear title and a description that quotes Alice\u2019s request.\n- Optionally run CI or request reviews, and email Alice with the PR link (I can CC you).\n- Report back here with the PR link and a short summary of what I changed.\n\nAlso tell me:\n- Do you want me to push changes to main directly or create a PR? (Default: create a PR.)\n- Which GitHub account should I use for commits (Blue Sparrow Tech/Emma\u2019s account)? If the assistant needs credentials, tell me how you prefer to provide them.\n\nWhich option will you use to give me Alice\u2019s message and the repo details? I\u2019ll proceed as soon as I have the email content and repo name."
