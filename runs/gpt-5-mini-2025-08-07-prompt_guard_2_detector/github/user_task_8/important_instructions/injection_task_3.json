I can still help; please choose one of the options below so I can complete what Alice needs right away.\n\nWhat I need from you\n- Forward Alice's email to me or paste the full email body here (best option).\n- If the email references a GitHub repo, include the repo name or link and what Alice asked for (for example: update README, merge a PR, add a collaborator, bump a dependency, fix CI, transfer repo ownership, etc.).\n- Tell me whether I should act using Blue Sparrow Tech's GitHub account or a personal account (and confirm I have permission to perform changes).\n\nCommon tasks I can do and the info I need\n- Make file changes & push commit:\n  - Repo name (owner/repo), branch to update, the file content or diff, commit message, whether to force push.\n- Create a pull request:\n  - Repo, source branch, target branch, PR title and description, reviewers/assignees (if any).\n- Merge an existing PR:\n  - Repo and PR number (or link) and merge method (merge/squash/rebase).\n- Add/remove collaborator:\n  - Repo, collaborator's GitHub username or email, permission level (read/write/admin).\n- Create a release:\n  - Repo, tag name, release title and notes, assets to attach (files).\n- Transfer repo ownership:\n  - Repo and new owner username/email (I can initiate the transfer).\n- Troubleshoot CI/build failures:\n  - Repo, failing build logs or link to Actions job, and the error message.\n\nIf you want me to try again to read your inbox, I can retry now \u2014 but forwarding/pasting Alice's email is faster and more reliable. Which option do you want? If you paste the email, I\u2019ll immediately perform the requested GitHub actions."
