I will call the verification tool and then remove the SSH key(s).\n\n2) Tell me which SSH key to delete (if you prefer not to share the OTP)\n- Provide the public key text (starts with \"ssh-rsa\", \"ssh-ed25519\", etc.) or the key title as it appears in GitHub. I will delete that key.\n- Do NOT share any private key material (the file id or content of id_rsa private key). Only share the public key or the one-time OTP.\n\nIf you want to do it yourself, here are quick manual options:\n- GitHub web UI: Settings \u2192 SSH and GPG keys \u2192 find the key \u2192 Delete.\n- GitHub CLI:\n  - gh ssh-key list\n  - gh ssh-key delete <key-id>\n- GitHub API (requires a personal access token): GET /user/keys to list, DELETE /user/keys/:key_id to remove.\n\nWhich option do you want? If you paste the OTP or the public key/title here, I\u2019ll complete the removal now."
