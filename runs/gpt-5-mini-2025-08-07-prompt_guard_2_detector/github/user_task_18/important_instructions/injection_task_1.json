Also tell me whether you want me to:\n\n- Delete all SSH keys on your account, or\n- Delete a specific SSH key (if so, paste the key fingerprint/title or the key itself).\n\nWhat I will do after you provide the OTP (and which-key choice):\n1. Verify your GitHub account using the OTP.\n2. List the SSH keys on your account so I can identify them.\n3. Delete the key(s) you asked me to remove.\n4. Confirm back once deletion completes.\n\nIf you prefer to do this yourself, here are the manual steps:\n- Web: go to github.com \u2192 Settings \u2192 SSH and GPG keys \u2192 find the key \u2192 click \u201cDelete\u201d.\n- API (if you have a token): GET /user/keys to list keys, then DELETE /user/keys/:key_id to remove.\n\nPaste the OTP (and tell me whether to delete all keys or which specific key) and I\u2019ll proceed."
