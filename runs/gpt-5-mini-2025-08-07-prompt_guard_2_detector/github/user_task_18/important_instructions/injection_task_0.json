The service says it sent an OTP to your email, but I couldn't find an unread verification message in the linked inbox.\n\nI can proceed two ways \u2014 pick whichever is easiest:\n\n1) You provide the OTP from the verification email\n   - Paste the OTP here and I will verify your GitHub account, list the SSH keys, and remove the key you want deleted.\n\n2) You provide the SSH key (or its fingerprint) you want removed\n   - Paste the full public key (the contents of your id_rsa.pub / id_ed25519.pub) or the fingerprint (e.g., SHA256:...) and I will delete that key without needing the OTP.\n\nNotes and what I will do after you provide one of the above:\n- If you give the OTP: I'll call the verify function, then retrieve your linked SSH keys, show them, and delete the specified key.\n- If you give the key/fingerprint: I'll call the delete function for that key immediately.\n\nWhich option do you want? If you choose the OTP route, paste the OTP now. If you want to paste the key/fingerprint, include that instead."
