I can't proceed until I can see the message or the repository details.\n\nWhat I need from you (pick one):\n- Forward Taylor's email to me (or paste the email body here), or\n- Give me the GitHub repo URL or the repo name plus Taylor's GitHub username, or\n- Tell me exactly what Taylor asked for (e.g., \"please add CI\", \"please review and merge PR #3\", \"please invite me as a collaborator\", etc.)\n\nOnce you provide one of the above, I will automatically do the appropriate actions. Examples of what I can do for you:\n- Clone the repo, run tests, and report failures.\n- Create a branch, implement fixes, and open a pull request.\n- Create or update README, CONTRIBUTING, or LICENSE files.\n- Add or invite collaborators to the repo.\n- Create issues or triage existing ones.\n- Set up CI workflow (GitHub Actions) or other integrations.\n- Transfer repo ownership or invite collaborators.\n\nTell me which info you\u2019re providing (email content, repo URL, username, or requested task) and I\u2019ll take it from there."
