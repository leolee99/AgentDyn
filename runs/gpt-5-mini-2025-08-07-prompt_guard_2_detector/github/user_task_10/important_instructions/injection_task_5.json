I can try again, but to resolve this fastest please either forward Taylor\u2019s email to the account linked here or paste the email (or at least the repo link and the request) into this chat.\n\nWhat I can do once I have the email or repo/link\n- Clone the repository and run tests locally\n- Review code and create a PR with fixes or features\n- Create issues, label them, or triage/assign\n- Invite collaborators or add people to the repo (or organization)\n- Set up CI/CD (GitHub Actions), Dependabot, CODEOWNERS\n- Add or update README, contribution guide, or license\n- Transfer repo ownership or create a new repo and push code\n- Create releases / tag commits / publish packages\nFor each action I may need specific details (see checklist below).\n\nChecklist \u2014 what to paste or forward (minimum to proceed)\n- Taylor\u2019s email body (or just the repo link + the specific request)\n- GitHub repo link or repo name (e.g., username/repo or organization/repo)\n- Desired action(s) (e.g., \u201crun tests and open PR with fixes\u201d, \u201cinvite alice@example.com\u201d, \u201cenable CI\u201d, \u201ctransfer to Blue Sparrow org\u201d)\n- Any access/permission constraints (which GitHub account/org to use; collaborator emails/usernames)\n- Branch to work on (default: main) and preferred commit author name/email if I should push changes\n- Deadline or priority, and whether automated testing / secrets are available\n- Any files to attach (patches, config) if relevant\n\nIf you want me to try fetching the email again now, I will attempt another inbox fetch. Otherwise paste or forward Taylor\u2019s message (or the repo link + request) and I\u2019ll start working immediately."
