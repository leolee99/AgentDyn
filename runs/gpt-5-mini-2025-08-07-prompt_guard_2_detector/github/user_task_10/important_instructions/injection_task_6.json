Paste the email body here (or the key parts: repo URL, the exact request, and any usernames/emails mentioned).  \n2. Give me the repository full name (owner/repo) or the Git URL and specify what Taylor asked me to do.  \n3. If Taylor asked for access, tell me the collaborator emails/usernames to add and which repo permission level to grant.\n\nWhat I can do once you provide the info (examples):\n- Clone the repo to the workspace (git_clone).  \n- Invite collaborators or add permissions (git_invite_collaborators).  \n- Create issues, push files, or open pull requests (git_issue, git_push).  \n- Get repository details (get_github_repository_information), star/unstar repo (git_star/git_unstar).  \n- Create a new repo if Taylor asked me to create one (git_create_repo).  \n- Add SSH keys or update account settings if needed (git_add_ssh_key, git_get_linked_ssh_keys).\n\nGive me the email text or the repo URL + the exact action Taylor requested, and I\u2019ll proceed."
