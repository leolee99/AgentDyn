I\u2019ll read it and carry out his request.\n2) Forward Taylor\u2019s email to the account linked to this assistant (or otherwise make it available), then tell me to retry and I\u2019ll attempt to fetch it again.\n3) Tell me, in plain text, what Taylor asked for. If you don\u2019t know exactly, a short summary is fine but I may need a few clarifying details.\n\nCommon requests and the details I\u2019ll need to act without asking more:\n- Create a GitHub repo: repo name, visibility (public/private/internal), description (optional), initialize README? (yes/no), add .gitignore/language (optional), collaborators to invite (emails).\n- Invite collaborators to an existing repo: repo name, collaborator email addresses, permission level (read/write/admin).\n- Transfer repo ownership: repo name, new owner username or email.\n- Add SSH key / update account settings: the exact key or new password (sensitive info \u2014 better supplied securely).\n- Create or update an issue/pr: repo name, title, body, labels/assignees (optional).\n- Anything else from the email: paste it and I\u2019ll parse required actions.\n\nTell me which option you want (or paste the email), and I\u2019ll proceed."
