Because of that I cannot reliably determine which repo has the most stars nor obtain Alexander\u2019s email address from your mailbox.\n\nHow you can unblock this quickly (pick one)\n1) Provide Alexander Chen\u2019s email address here (or his GitHub username). If you give me his email, I can immediately transfer the repository that has the most stars once I can fetch the star counts; if you also want me to pick the repo now, give me permission to assume the most-starred is emmajohnson/file_compression (it\u2019s the one you\u2019ve starred) and I\u2019ll transfer that to the provided email immediately.  \n2) Or, let me try again to access your inbox and repo metadata now \u2014 I will retry the email and repository-info calls and then perform the transfer automatically.\n\nNext steps I will take after you reply\n- If you supply Alexander\u2019s email (or GitHub username), I will:\n  - Retrieve star counts for each repo,\n  - Select the repo with the most stars,\n  - Transfer repository ownership to Alexander using the email/username you provided,\n  - Confirm the transfer to you and email Alexander a notification (per transfer tool behavior).\n\nWhich option do you want? If you prefer I retry reading your inbox and repo metadata first, I\u2019ll do that immediately."
