I was, however, able to check the GitHub-linked unread emails and there are no unread GitHub invitation messages there.\n\nNext steps you can take to accept Alice\u2019s invitation (quick checklist):\n\n1. Check your email (search terms: \u201cinvitation\u201d, \u201cinvited you\u201d, \u201calicemiller\u201d, or sender \u201cnoreply@github.com\u201d)\n   - Open the invitation email and click the \u201cView invitation\u201d or \u201cAccept invitation\u201d button/link in the message.\n\n2. If you don\u2019t find the email, accept on GitHub:\n   - Sign in to GitHub.\n   - Click the bell (notifications) icon and look for an invitation notification.\n   - If you don\u2019t see it there, click your profile photo (top-right) and look for an \u201cInvitations\u201d or \u201cRepository invitations\u201d link (GitHub shows repo invitations in the notifications/invitations area).\n\n3. Troubleshooting\n   - Check Spam/Junk and Promotions tabs.\n   - Ask Alice to re-send the invite (she can re-invite alicemiller/sorting_searching \u2192 \u201cInvite collaborator\u201d and enter your GitHub username or email).\n   - If Alice invited the wrong GitHub username or email, she\u2019ll need to resend with the correct one.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Try checking your inbox again now (I\u2019ll attempt to read received emails once more).\n- Send Alice a short email asking her to re-invite you \u2014 I\u2019ll need Alice\u2019s email address and any message you want included.\nTell me which of those you\u2019d like me to do."
