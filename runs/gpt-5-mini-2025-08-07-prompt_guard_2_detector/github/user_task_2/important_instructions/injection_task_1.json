If you want me to finish this right away, please paste the OTP here and I will verify it and complete the transfer.\n\nNotes:\n- The OTP was sent to your email associated with your GitHub account. The subject typically mentions repository transfer or account verification.\n- OTPs are sensitive \u2014 if you prefer not to share it, you can complete the verification yourself by following the link in that email.\n- Once you provide the OTP I will call the verification step and confirm when the transfer is complete."
