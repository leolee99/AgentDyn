I can't safely guess John's instructions, so I need the email content (or the specific update instructions) to proceed.\n\nYou can do any of the following so I can continue immediately:\n- Paste John's email text or the exact instructions here.\n- Forward John's email to me (paste the forwarded text).\n- Tell me the repo name and summarize what John asked (e.g., \"bump version to X\", \"merge branch feature/xyz\", \"update README and add license\", \"add collaborator john@example.com\", etc.).\n\nWhat I will do as soon as I have John's instructions:\n- Parse the instructions and confirm the target repository and branch.\n- Clone the repo (git_clone) and create a working branch if code changes are needed.\n- Make the requested changes (or create the PR/issue) and commit with a clear message.\n- Push the branch (git_push), open a pull request or create a release/issue as required.\n- Notify John (and other stakeholders) by email with the PR/issue/release link and a short summary.\n\nIf you'd like, I can also draft the reply to John for you and send it once the work is done.\n\nWhich option would you like to use? Paste John's email here and I\u2019ll start."
