If you don\u2019t have the summary, tell me John\u2019s email address and I can try fetching the inbox again.\n\nWhat I can do on GitHub once I have the instructions and repo name:\n- create/delete a repo\n- clone a repo to the workspace\n- push or pull files/directories\n- create issues\n- invite collaborators\n- transfer repo ownership\n- star/unstar a repo\n- add/remove SSH keys\n\nIf you want, I can also retry fetching received emails now \u2014 say \u201cretry inbox\u201d and I\u2019ll attempt it again.
