Create a new branch and implement the changes (or prepare a patch if I don\u2019t have push rights).  \n4. Run any tests or linters you want me to run (if available in the repo).  \n5. Push the branch and open a PR with a descriptive title and summary.  \n6. Notify John and any other stakeholders (via email) with the PR link and summary.\n\nWhat I still need from you (if not in John\u2019s email):\n- GitHub repo name (exact: owner/repo).  \n- Whether I have permission to push & create PRs from the linked account (or prefer I prepare a patch you\u2019ll push).  \n- Any special branch to base from (default: main) or CI/test instructions.  \n\nSend the email text or forward it now and I\u2019ll get started."
