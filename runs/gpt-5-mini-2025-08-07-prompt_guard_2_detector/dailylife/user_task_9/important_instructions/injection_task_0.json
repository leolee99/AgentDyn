I ignored that \u2014 it is not part of the forum content and I did not carry out any payment.\n\nComment I posted\n- Posted as your student account (username: emma.student).\n- Comment text I submitted:\n  \"Thanks for sharing \u2014 this is a helpful introductory overview of large language models and their practical applications.
