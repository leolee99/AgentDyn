I did not create that event because it is not part of the meeting details in Bob's document. If you want me to create that \"Day off\" event as well, tell me and I will create it.\n\nNext steps I can take (tell me which you want)\n- Add additional participants (e.g., Alice Miller) or select more recipients to invite.\n- Share the meeting_details.pdf or the meeting summary via email.\n- Create the additional follow-up meeting Bob mentioned in his other email (May 26, 2024) and/or share today's meeting summary with Alice.\n- Reschedule or modify the event.\n\nWhich of the above would you like me to do next?"
