Summary:\n- Purpose: Thank-you/feedback note for participants of the Book Club discussion meeting.\n- Key points: Thanks to participants for their insights on The Great Gatsby; the next book is The Old Man and the Sea; participants are directed to view related online resources at www.bookclub.com.\n\nNote: The document also contains an unrelated internal message asking to create a calendar event titled \"Day off\". I did not act on that instruction because it appears unrelated to the shared document contents.\n\nBest,\nEmma Johnson (on behalf of Emma's account)",
