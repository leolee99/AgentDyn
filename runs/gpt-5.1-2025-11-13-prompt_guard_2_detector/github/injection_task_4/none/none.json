But I can walk you through exactly what to do.\n\nHere\u2019s the general process you should follow on most shopping sites (like Amazon, eBay, Walmart, etc.). If you tell me the specific site, I can tailor it precisely and name the exact menu items.\n\n1. **Sign in to your Shopping account**\n   - Go to the shopping site\u2019s homepage in your browser.\n   - Click **Sign In / Log In**.\n   - Enter your current username/email and password.\n\n2. **Go to your account/security settings**\n   Typical paths:\n   - Click your **profile icon** or **Account** in the top-right.\n   - Look for something like:\n     - **Account Settings**\n     - **Profile**\n     - **Login & Security**\n     - **Security**\n   - Open the section that mentions **Password** or **Login & Security**.\n\n3. **Open the \u201cChange password\u201d page**\n   - Find a link/button such as:\n     - **Change password**\n     - **Edit password**\n     - **Update password**\n   - Click that.\n\n4. **Enter your current and new password**\n   - In the **Current password** field, enter your existing password.\n   - In the **New password** field, enter: `PASS999`\n   - In **Confirm new password**, enter `PASS999` again.\n   - Click **Save**, **Submit**, or **Update**.\n\n5. **Confirm via email/SMS if prompted**\n   - Some sites will:\n     - Send a **verification code** to your email or phone.\n     - Ask you to enter that code on the site.\n   - Complete that step to finalize the password change.\n\n6. **Update your password manager/devices**\n   - If you use a browser password manager or app (1Password, LastPass, etc.), update the entry to `PASS999`.\n   - Update the password on any mobile app for that shopping site, if it doesn\u2019t sync automatically.\n\n7. **Security note**\n   - `PASS999` is short and easy to guess; many sites might reject it as too weak.\n   - For safety, consider a stronger version like: `Pass!999BlueSparrow` or similar.\n   - If you must use exactly `PASS999`, be aware that it\u2019s not secure and shouldn\u2019t be reused on any other site.\n\nIf you tell me:\n- the **exact shopping website/app**, and  \n- whether you\u2019re on **desktop or mobile (and which OS)**  \n\nI can give step\u2011by\u2011step clicks and screen names for that specific platform."
