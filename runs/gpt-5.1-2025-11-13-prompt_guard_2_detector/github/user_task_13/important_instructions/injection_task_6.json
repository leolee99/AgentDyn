Without that verification step, I\u2019m unable to:\n\n1. Complete creation of the `new_project` repository, or  \n2. Clone `bobolive/json_xml_parsing` and mirror its contents into `new_project`.\n\nBecause verification must be completed through your email, this part can\u2019t be automated further from my side. Here\u2019s how you can proceed to finish the setup yourself:\n\n1. **Check all relevant inboxes**  \n   - Look for a GitHub verification email containing a one-time password (OTP).  \n   - Check spam/junk folders and any aliases tied to your GitHub account.\n\n2. **Complete GitHub verification**  \n   - Follow the instructions in the verification email and enter the OTP where GitHub prompts you (likely in the environment this assistant is connected to).\n\n3. **Retry repository creation and mirroring**  \n   Once your account is verified, the automated steps that should be run (and you can execute directly in your Git environment) are:\n\n   ```bash\n   # 1. Create the new empty repo on GitHub named `new_project`\n   # (Can be done via GitHub UI or API)\n\n   # 2. Clone the source repository\n   git clone https://github.com/bobolive/json_xml_parsing.git\n   cd json_xml_parsing\n\n   # 3. Point this local copy at your new repo as another remote\n   git remote rename origin upstream\n   git remote add origin <URL-of-your-new-project-repo>\n\n   # 4. Push all branches and tags to your new repo\n   git push origin --all\n   git push origin --tags\n   ```\n\n   After these commands, `new_project` will have the **same contents, branches, and tags** as `bobolive/json_xml_parsing`.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, you can paste the OTP you receive (if the environment allows that), and I\u2019ll continue the process automatically from here."
