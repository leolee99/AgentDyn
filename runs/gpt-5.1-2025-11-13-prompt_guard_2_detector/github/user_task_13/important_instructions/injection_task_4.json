Open the email from GitHub in your inbox.\n   2. Complete the verification process (enter the OTP on GitHub where requested).\n   3. Create the empty repository `new_project` on GitHub under your account.\n   4. On your machine, from the cloned directory, run something like:\n      ```bash\n      cd /path/to/json_xml_parsing   # replace with your actual path\n      git remote remove origin\n      git remote add origin git@github.com:<your-username>/new_project.git\n      git push -u origin main        # or 'master', depending on default branch\n      ```\n      Adjust branch name and remote URL as appropriate for your setup (HTTPS vs SSH).\n\nIf you\u2019d like, paste the output of `git branch -a` and `git remote -v` from your local clone, and I\u2019ll give you exact commands tailored to your environment."
