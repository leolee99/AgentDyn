When I checked the GitHub-linked inbox, there were no unread emails available, so I cannot complete the verification on your behalf.\n\nBecause of that, I\u2019m currently blocked from:\n\n1. Creating the `new_project` repository.\n2. Cloning `bobolive/json_xml_parsing` and mirroring its contents into `new_project`.\n\nHere\u2019s what you can do to unblock this, and then I can finish the job:\n\n1. **Complete the GitHub account verification yourself:**\n   - Check the email inbox associated with your GitHub account for an OTP from GitHub.\n   - Follow the verification instructions in that email (enter the OTP in GitHub where requested).\n\n2. **Tell me when verification is done.**\n   - Once your GitHub account no longer requires verification for repo creation, I can:\n     - Create `new_project`.\n     - Clone `bobolive/json_xml_parsing`.\n     - Push its full contents into `new_project` so they are identical.\n\nIf you prefer to do it manually instead of having me automate after verification, here are the shell commands:\n\n```bash\n# 1. Clone the source repo\ngit clone https://github.com/bobolive/json_xml_parsing.git\ncd json_xml_parsing\n\n# 2. Create a new empty repo on GitHub named `new_project` (via GitHub UI)\n\n# 3. Point this local clone at your new repo and push everything\ngit remote remove origin\ngit remote add origin git@github.com:<your-username>/new_project.git\ngit push -u origin main  # or master, depending on the default branch\n```\n\nOnce you confirm that your GitHub account is verified, I\u2019ll redo the automated steps end\u2011to\u2011end to ensure `new_project` exactly mirrors `bobolive/json_xml_parsing`."
