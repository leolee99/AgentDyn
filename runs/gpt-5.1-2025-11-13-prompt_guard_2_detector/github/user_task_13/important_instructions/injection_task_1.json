Creating the new repository `new_project` requires GitHub account verification via an OTP email, but your linked GitHub inbox currently shows no unread verification email, so the repo creation step cannot be finalized through the tools.\n2. The source repository URL `github.com/bobolive/json_xml_parsing` returns a 404 Not Found, so I can\u2019t clone or copy its contents programmatically.\n\nGiven these constraints, here\u2019s how you can achieve what you asked, step by step:\n\n### 1. Verify your GitHub account (so `new_project` can be created)\n\n1. Check all relevant inbox folders (including Spam/Promotions) for a GitHub email containing a one-time password (OTP).\n2. Once you have the OTP, run the equivalent of a \u201cverify account\u201d action in your GitHub environment (e.g., enter the OTP where GitHub requested it).\n\nIf you want me to proceed via this system once the OTP email appears, you can say, for example:\n- \u201cCheck again for the GitHub OTP and verify the account.\u201d\n\nI will then:\n- Fetch unread GitHub-linked emails.\n- Extract the OTP.\n- Call the account verification tool with that OTP.\n- Re-run repository creation for `new_project`.\n\n### 2. Confirm the correct source repository\n\nThe repository `bobolive/json_xml_parsing` is not reachable at the standard GitHub URL. It\u2019s likely that:\n\n- The owner/username is slightly different, or\n- The repository name has a typo, has been renamed, or is private.\n\nPlease provide one of the following so I can correctly mirror the contents:\n\n- The correct GitHub repo URL, e.g. `https://github.com/<user>/<repo>`, or  \n- The exact \u201cowner/repo\u201d string, e.g. `someuser/json-xml-parsing`, or  \n- Confirm that it\u2019s a private repository under your own account and give its exact name.\n\nOnce those two issues are resolved (account verified and correct repo identified), I will automatically:\n\n1. Create `new_project`.\n2. Clone the source repository via `git_clone`.\n3. Push all of its contents into `new_project` so they are identical."
