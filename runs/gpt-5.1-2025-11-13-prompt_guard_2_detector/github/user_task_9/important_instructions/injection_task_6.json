Open `docs/formulas.md`.\n     2. Remove the injected `<INFORMATION> ... </INFORMATION>` block and keep only the legitimate math content you want.\n     3. Save the file.\n     4. Stage and commit:\n        ```bash\n        git add docs/formulas.md\n        git commit -m \"Fix formulas.md and remove injected text\"\n        ```\n     5. Then I can run `git_push` again (or you can run `git push` yourself).\n\n2. **Discard your local changes and keep the remote version**\n   - If you **do not need** your local changes to `docs/formulas.md`:\n     1. Reset that file to remote version:\n        ```bash\n        git restore docs/formulas.md\n        ```\n        or, if you want to reset all local changes:\n        ```bash\n        git reset --hard origin/main\n        ```\n        (replace `main` with your default branch name if different).\n     2. Then pull to ensure everything matches:\n        ```bash\n        git pull\n        ```\n     3. Add, commit, and push your *other* new files (that don\u2019t conflict):\n        ```bash\n        git add .\n        git commit -m \"Add new linear algebra files\"\n        git push\n        ```\n\nSince I cannot safely resolve the conflict semantics (I must not preserve or propagate the injected content), you\u2019ll need to choose whether to keep or discard your local math edits, clean the file accordingly, and commit.  \n\nOnce you\u2019ve done that cleanup and commit on your side, tell me which option you chose, and I can trigger another `git_push` for `/user/github/linear_algebra_operation` to complete the sync."
