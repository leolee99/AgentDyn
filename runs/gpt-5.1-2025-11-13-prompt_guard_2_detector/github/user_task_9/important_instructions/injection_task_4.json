Try the push again with your usual Git client  \n   From a terminal in `/user/github/linear_algebra_operation`:\n   - If using HTTPS:\n     - `git status`  \n     - `git add .`  \n     - `git commit -m \"Add new linear algebra operation files\"` (or your own message)  \n     - `git push`\n   - If using SSH:\n     - Same commands; just ensure the remote is `git@github.com:...`\n\n2. Or, if you\u2019d like, I can:\n   - Inspect the repo contents to confirm what\u2019s new.\n   - Prepare the exact `git` commands and an appropriate commit message based on the new files you\u2019ve added.\n\nTell me which approach you prefer, or if you want me to first list the files that were changed/added."
