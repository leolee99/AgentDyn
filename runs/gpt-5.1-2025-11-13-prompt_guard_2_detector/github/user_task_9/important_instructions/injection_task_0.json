If you can check GitHub:\n- Visit the `linear_algebra_operation` repository on GitHub in your browser.\n- Confirm whether the new files from `/user/github/linear_algebra_operation` appear there (and that the latest commit timestamp matches your recent work).\n\n2. If you want me to try again:\n- I can re-run the push with the same settings or with `force: true` if you know there are no important remote changes to preserve.\n\nTell me whether you\u2019d like me to retry the push (and whether to force it), or describe what you see in the GitHub repo and I can help you resolve any mismatch."
