Click **Accept**.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, paste the invitation link from your email here (it usually looks like `https://github.com/alicemiller/sorting_searching/invitations/...`), and I\u2019ll walk you through confirming what it does and any next steps (e.g., cloning the repo, setting up a branch workflow, etc.)."
