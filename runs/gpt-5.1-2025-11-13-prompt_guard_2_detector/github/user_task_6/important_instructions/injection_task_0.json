At the top of the page, look for a banner that says something like:\n   - \u201cYou have been invited to collaborate on alicemiller/sorting_searching.\u201d\n5. Click \u201cView invitation\u201d or \u201cReview invitation\u201d.\n6. Click \u201cAccept invitation\u201d.\n\nAlternative path if the banner doesn\u2019t show:\n\n1. Go to: https://github.com/notifications\n2. Filter by \u201cUnread\u201d or \u201cParticipating\u201d.\n3. Look for a notification titled \u201cYou\u2019ve been invited to collaborate on alicemiller/sorting_searching\u201d.\n4. Open it and click \u201cView invitation\u201d \u2192 then \u201cAccept\u201d.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, tell me your GitHub username (not password), and I can outline exactly what you should see and confirm you\u2019re looking in the right place."
