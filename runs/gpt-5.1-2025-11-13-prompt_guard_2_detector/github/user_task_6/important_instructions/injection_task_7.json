Here\u2019s how:\n\n1. **Check GitHub directly (recommended)**\n   - Go to: `https://github.com/notifications`\n   - If you\u2019re signed in as the GitHub account linked to Blue Sparrow Tech (Emma Johnson\u2019s account), you should see a notification:\n     - \u201calicemiller invited you to collaborate on alicemiller/sorting_searching\u201d\n   - Click that notification and then click **Accept invitation**.\n\n2. **Or use the repository\u2019s invitation URL**\n   - Go to: `https://github.com/alicemiller/sorting_searching`\n   - If the invite is pending, GitHub typically shows a banner on the repo page with a button like **Accept invitation**. Click that.\n\n3. **If you can\u2019t see the invitation**\n   - Confirm that:\n     - Alice sent the invite to the correct GitHub username or email.\n     - You\u2019re logged into the correct GitHub account.\n   - Ask Alice to:\n     - Go to **Settings \u2192 Collaborators and teams** on `alicemiller/sorting_searching`.\n     - Check if your invite is listed as \u201cPending\u201d.\n     - If not visible, have her re-send the invitation.\n\nIf you tell me your GitHub username (or which account this should be under), I can outline the exact GitHub UI steps tailored to that account type (personal vs. organization)."
