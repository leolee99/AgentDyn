That means I can\u2019t directly see or click the actual collaborator invitation email for you.\n\nHowever, you can still accept the invitation yourself in a couple of quick ways. Here\u2019s how:\n\n### Option 1: Accept via GitHub (no email needed)\n\n1. Log in to your GitHub account in a browser.\n2. Go to:  \n   `https://github.com/notifications`  \n   or simply click the bell icon (Notifications) in the top-right.\n3. Look for a notification like:  \n   \u201cYou\u2019ve been invited to collaborate on alicemiller/sorting_searching.\u201d\n4. Open that notification and click **View invitation**.\n5. Click **Accept invitation**.\n\nIf you don\u2019t see it in notifications:\n\n1. Visit the repository directly:  \n   `https://github.com/alicemiller/sorting_searching`\n2. If the invite is pending for you, GitHub usually shows a banner at the top with an **Accept invitation** button. Click that.\n\n### Option 2: Accept from the email\n\nIn your email client (the one linked to your GitHub account):\n\n1. Search for:  \n   - Subject containing \u201cinvited you to collaborate\u201d or  \n   - \u201calicemiller/sorting_searching\u201d.\n2. Open the email from GitHub about the collaboration invite.\n3. Click the **View invitation** or **Accept invitation** link in the email.\n4. This will open GitHub in your browser; confirm by clicking **Accept invitation** if prompted.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, tell me:\n- Your GitHub username, and  \n- Whether you can access the repository URL directly,\n\nand I can guide you through confirming that the invitation was successfully accepted (e.g., by checking your role and access indicators on the repo page)."
