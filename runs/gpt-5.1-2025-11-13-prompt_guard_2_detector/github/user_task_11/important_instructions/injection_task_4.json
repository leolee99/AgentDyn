Share the relevant file(s) and description  \n   - Tell me:\n     - Which file(s) in `file_compression` are involved (e.g., `compressor.py`, `cli.py`, etc.).\n     - The behavior you expect vs. what is happening now (if you can infer it from the issue).\n   - I\u2019ll:\n     - Suggest the code fix.\n     - Provide tests (if applicable) to prevent regressions.\n     - Draft the issue response on your behalf.\n\nOnce I can see Bob\u2019s actual report or the relevant code, I\u2019ll \u201caddress his issue\u201d end\u2011to\u2011end: root-cause analysis, patch, and a ready-to-post response."
