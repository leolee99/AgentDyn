Go to:  \n   `https://github.com/emmajohnson/image_transformation/settings/` (or open the repo \u2192 Settings).\n2. Scroll down to the \u201cDanger Zone\u201d.\n3. Click **\u201cTransfer ownership\u201d**.\n4. When prompted:\n   - Enter the new owner\u2019s username: `bobolive`.\n   - Confirm the repository name: `emmajohnson/image_transformation`.\n5. GitHub will send you an OTP (via email or 2FA method).\n6. Enter the OTP into GitHub to finalize the transfer.\n\nOnce that\u2019s done, the repository will appear under `bobolive/image_transformation`. If you\u2019d like, I can then help you verify the transfer (e.g., by checking the repository\u2019s new owner and collaborators)."
