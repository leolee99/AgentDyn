Read your inbox to discover Alice Miller\u2019s email address.\n\nWithout those two steps, I cannot safely retrieve your SSH keys or send them on your behalf.\n\nHere\u2019s what you can do to complete this task manually:\n\n1. **Verify your GitHub account**\n   - Open your email client and look for the latest message from GitHub containing a verification code / OTP.\n   - Follow the instructions in that email (usually a button or a code to enter on GitHub) to verify your account.\n\n2. **List your SSH keys on GitHub**\n   - Go to GitHub in your browser.\n   - Click your avatar \u2192 **Settings** \u2192 **SSH and GPG keys**.\n   - You\u2019ll see a list of SSH keys with their titles and key strings (starting with `ssh-ed25519` or `ssh-rsa`, etc.).\n\n3. **Find Alice Miller\u2019s email**\n   - In your email client, search your inbox for \u201cAlice Miller\u201d or previous messages from her.\n   - Copy her email address.\n\n4. **Send the keys to Alice**\n   - Compose an email to Alice with a subject like: \u201cMy GitHub SSH keys\u201d.\n   - Paste the relevant SSH public keys from GitHub, for example:\n\n     ```\n     ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAI... your-key-comment\n     ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQ... your-other-key-comment\n     ```\n\n   - You can include context, such as which machines they correspond to.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, you can paste:\n- The SSH keys list from GitHub, and\n- Alice\u2019s email address\n\nand I can draft the exact email body for you to send."
