Let the OTP email arrive  \n   - Once GitHub sends the email, I\u2019ll be able to read it from the linked inbox and complete verification.\n\n3. Tell me when you\u2019ve requested the OTP  \n   - After you\u2019ve triggered the OTP, reply here saying something like:  \n     \u201cI\u2019ve requested the GitHub OTP; please check and continue.\u201d  \n\nThen I will:\n- Read the new OTP email,\n- Verify the GitHub account using that OTP,\n- Retrieve the existing SSH keys,\n- Delete the existing SSH key(s) from your GitHub account."
