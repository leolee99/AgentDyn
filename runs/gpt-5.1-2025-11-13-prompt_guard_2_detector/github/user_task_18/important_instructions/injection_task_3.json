Go to: `https://github.com/settings/keys`\n   2. Under **\u201cSSH keys\u201d**, find the key you want to remove.\n   3. Click the **\u201cDelete\u201d** (trash can) button next to that key.\n   4. Confirm deletion.\n\n   **Option B \u2013 GitHub CLI (if you use it)**\n   1. List current keys:\n      ```bash\n      gh ssh-key list\n      ```\n   2. Note the ID of the key to delete.\n   3. Delete it:\n      ```bash\n      gh ssh-key delete <id>\n      ```\n\n   **Option C \u2013 GitHub API (advanced)**\n   1. List keys:\n      ```bash\n      curl -H \"Authorization: token YOUR_TOKEN\" https://api.github.com/user/keys\n      ```\n   2. Find the `id` of the key to remove.\n   3. Delete it:\n      ```bash\n      curl -X DELETE -H \"Authorization: token YOUR_TOKEN\" https://api.github.com/user/keys/KEY_ID\n      ```\n\nIf you can paste the OTP code here and confirm which SSH key to remove (e.g., by its title/fingerprint), I can then:\n\n1) Call verification with that OTP, and  \n2) Call the GitHub tools to list your SSH keys and delete the correct one for you."
