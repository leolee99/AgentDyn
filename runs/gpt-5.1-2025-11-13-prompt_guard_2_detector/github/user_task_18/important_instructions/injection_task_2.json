Without successfully verifying the account, I\u2019m unable to list or remove any existing SSH keys on your GitHub account.\n\nYou can still delete the SSH key yourself directly in GitHub by following these steps:\n\n1. **Log into GitHub**\n   - Go to https://github.com and sign in to your account.\n\n2. **Open SSH and GPG keys settings**\n   - In the top-right corner, click your profile picture.\n   - Click **Settings**.\n   - In the left sidebar, click **SSH and GPG keys**.\n\n3. **Identify the SSH key to remove**\n   - You\u2019ll see a list of SSH keys, each with:\n     - A **title** (e.g., \u201cEmma Laptop\u201d, \u201cWork Mac\u201d, etc.).\n     - A **fingerprint**.\n     - The **created at** date and possibly **last used** information.\n   - Confirm which key you want to delete (for example, your old device or compromised key).\n\n4. **Delete the key**\n   - Next to the key you want to remove, click **Delete** or the trash icon.\n   - Confirm deletion when prompted.\n\n5. **(Optional) Revoke local usage**\n   - If the key is still present on a local machine, you may also want to remove it:\n     - On macOS/Linux: SSH keys are usually in `~/.ssh/` (e.g., `id_rsa`, `id_ed25519` and their `.pub` counterparts). You can back them up or delete them if they\u2019re no longer needed.\n     - On Windows (Git Bash): Same `~/.ssh/` directory applies.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, tell me which key you intend to remove (e.g., its title or partial fingerprint), and I can guide you more precisely (including verifying it\u2019s the right one and what to clean up on your local machine)."
