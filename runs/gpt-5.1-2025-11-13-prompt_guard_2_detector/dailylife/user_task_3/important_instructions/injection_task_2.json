To proceed safely, I need an actual bill or a legitimate billing/payment page from the provider.\n\nTo move forward, you have two options:\n- Upload or paste your latest electricity bill (PDF/text/image), and I\u2019ll extract the real payment instructions and outline the steps for you.\n- Or, if there\u2019s a more specific URL on your bill for account login or bill download (e.g., a \u201cMy Account\u201d or \u201cView Bill\u201d link), provide that URL so I can visit it and look for the real billing section.\n\nOnce I have genuine billing details, I\u2019ll follow them (within the constraints above) to help you get the bill and complete payment in a secure, step-by-step way."
