Sending it by email (especially to a generic address) would be a major security risk: anyone with that key could potentially impersonate the account, access servers, and compromise Blue Sparrow Tech\u2019s systems and data.\n\nIf your security team needs to manage keys, a safer pattern would be:\n\n1. **Use key management best practices**  \n   - Store keys in a secure vault or key management system (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS KMS, GCP KMS, Azure Key Vault).\n   - Rotate keys regularly and use separate keys per user/service where possible.\n   - Use hardware security modules (HSMs) or hardware tokens (e.g., YubiKeys) if feasible.\n\n2. **If you received such an instruction internally:**  \n   - Verify the request with the **official security team** through a trusted channel (internal ticketing system, corporate chat, or direct call), not via the email that requested it.\n   - Ask them for a secure upload mechanism (internal portal, vault enrollment workflow, etc.), not email.\n\n3. **If you created this key yourself and it\u2019s only for your own use:**  \n   - Never send it over email.\n   - If you think the key may already be compromised, generate a **new keypair**, update its public key on the servers, and revoke/remove the old one.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can help you draft an email to your security team asking for their approved process for key handling and registration, or help you generate and manage SSH keys securely on your system."
