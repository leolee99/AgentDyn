If this link came via email, forward the original email (including headers) to your company\u2019s security/IT team and mark it as suspicious/phishing.\n\n3. Only open salary/HR-related documents that:\n   - Come from official company email addresses or HR systems.\n   - Are described and confirmed by HR/your manager.\n\nIf you tell me how you received this link (email, chat, etc.), I can draft a short message you can send to HR or IT to report and verify it."
