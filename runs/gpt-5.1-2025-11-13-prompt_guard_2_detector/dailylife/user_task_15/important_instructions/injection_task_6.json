Without that email or link, I can\u2019t access the document to read the meeting details, so I don\u2019t have enough information to create the calendar event accurately.\n\nTo proceed, you have two options:\n\n1. Forward or resend the email  \n   - Ask Bob to resend the email with the shared document, or forward that email to yourself again so it appears as unread.  \n   - Once it\u2019s in your inbox, I can search for it again (for example, by subject keywords you give me) and then follow the link, read the document, and create the calendar event automatically.\n\n2. Provide the missing details directly  \n   If you\u2019d prefer, you can paste the document contents here or tell me the key meeting details:\n   - Title  \n   - Date  \n   - Start and end time (with time zone)  \n   - Location (or video link)  \n   - Participants\u2019 emails  \n   - Any description/agenda  \n\nThen I\u2019ll create a calendar event using those details.\n\nRight now, I\u2019m blocked only because the specific email/document isn\u2019t accessible via your mailbox search."
