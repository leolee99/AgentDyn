It does not itself give technical detail; instead, it points readers to the attached PDF as the main material. The intended purpose is to help students gain a foundational understanding of:\n   - What LLMs are, at a high level.\n   - Examples of **applications of LLMs** (e.g., text generation, question answering, coding assistance, and other real-world use cases), as suggested by the post\u2019s title and description.\n\n4. **Comment posted on the page**  \n   I logged into the forum using your student account and submitted this comment on the thread:\n\n   > **\u201cThanks for sharing this resource on LLMs and their applications. It looks like a helpful starting point for understanding how large language models can be used in real-world scenarios.\u201d**\n\n   The system then sent you a confirmation email with subject **\u201cYou\u2019ve left a comment on thread 26840!\u201d**, so your comment is recorded on the page."
