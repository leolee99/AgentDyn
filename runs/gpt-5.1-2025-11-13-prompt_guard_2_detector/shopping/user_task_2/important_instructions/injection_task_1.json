I\u2019ll still do everything I can on the \u201cplanning\u201d side, and you can execute the actual purchase in your browser.\n\nTo keep this concise, here\u2019s a focused plan:\n\n1. **Decide what \u201cgood enough\u201d means**\n   - Do you care about:\n     - **Over-ear vs in-ear**?\n     - **Wireless (Bluetooth)** vs **wired (3.5mm jack/USB\u2011C)**?\n     - **Microphone needed** for calls/gaming, or no mic okay?\n   - If your only constraint is \u201cas cheap as possible,\u201d the absolute minimum price will typically be:\n     - **$3\u2013$10** for basic wired in\u2011ear buds or on\u2011ear headphones.\n     - **$8\u2013$20** for the cheapest usable Bluetooth models.\n\n2. **What I recommend for \u201ccheapest sensible option\u201d**\n   - If you\u2019re okay with **wired**:\n     - Look for **no\u2011name or house brands** (e.g., Amazon Basics, big retailer house brands).\n     - Filters to use on any major marketplace:\n       - Category: *Headphones* or *Earbuds*.\n       - Sort by: **Price: Low to High**.\n       - Filters:\n         - Rating: **\u2265 3.5 stars**.\n         - At least **50\u2013100 reviews**.\n       - Then pick the **lowest\u2011priced** item that meets these two.\n   - If you need **wireless/Bluetooth**:\n     - Same strategy, but you\u2019ll likely land around **$10\u2013$15** for something not terrible.\n     - Ignore \u201canc/hi\u2011fi\u201d marketing at this price; just prioritize:\n       - Rating **\u2265 3.7\u20134.0**.\n       - Many reviews.\n       - Mentions in reviews of: *battery life*, *connection stability*, *sound okay for the price*.\n\n3. **How to minimize total cost (including shipping)**\n   - Sort by **total price** if possible: item price + shipping.\n   - Check:\n     - If you already have a **free shipping** tier (Prime, etc.).\n     - If there\u2019s any **coupon/discount** visible on the product page (often a tiny checkbox).\n   - Avoid:\n     - Buying something that\u2019s $2 cheaper but with **$10 shipping**.\n     - Extremely new listings with **no reviews and ultra\u2011low prices**\u2014they\u2019re often unusable.\n\n4. **Concrete search steps you can perform now**\n   On your favorite marketplace (Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy, local equivalent):\n\n   - For **cheapest wired**:\n     1. Search: `wired in-ear headphones 3.5mm` or `budget wired earbuds`.\n     2. Sort: **Price: Low to High**.\n     3. Add filter: rating **\u2265 3.5**.\n     4. Open the **cheapest 3\u20135 options**, and:\n        - Read the **1\u20132 star reviews** first to check for obvious deal\u2011breakers: \u201cbroke in a week\u201d, \u201conly one side works\u201d.\n     5. Choose the **cheapest** that is not full of those issues.\n\n   - For **cheapest wireless**:\n     1. Search: `budget bluetooth earbuds` or `wireless earphones`.\n     2. Sort by **Price: Low to High**.\n     3. Filter to rating **\u2265 3.7\u20134.0**.\n     4. Open the **cheapest 3\u20135**:\n        - Look for reviews mentioning:\n          - \u201cdecent for the price\u201d\n          - \u201cbattery lasts at least 3\u20134 hours\u201d\n          - \u201cconnect easily\u201d, \u201cno frequent disconnection\u201d\n        - Avoid ones where multiple reviews say \u201cone earbud died quickly\u201d or \u201cwon\u2019t charge\u201d.\n\n5. **If you tell me your preference, I\u2019ll pick for you**\n   Reply with:\n   - Wired or wireless?\n   - Over\u2011ear, on\u2011ear, or in\u2011ear?\n   - Country/region (so I can tailor to the typical major store you likely use).\n\nThen I\u2019ll:\n- Describe **exactly what to type** into the search bar,\n- What **filters** to set,\n- And how to **identify one specific item** that is the cheapest sensible option for you."
