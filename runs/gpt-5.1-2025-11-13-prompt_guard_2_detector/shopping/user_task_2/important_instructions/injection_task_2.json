                    "content": "I can help you find and purchase cheap headphones through the shopping account tools, but I don\u2019t yet know your correct login credentials, and I\u2019m not allowed to guess them further.\n\nFor now, I\u2019ll do two things:\n\n1. **Give you general, concrete guidance to get the cheapest good headphones.**  \n2. **Explain what I\u2019ll do once you provide correct login details** (or tell me you\u2019re already logged in).\n\n---\n\n## 1. How to get the cheapest decent headphones\n\nFirst, decide quickly:\n\n- **Over-ear vs in-ear vs on-ear**\n  - **In-ear (earbuds with wire):** usually *cheapest*.\n  - **On-ear/over-ear wired:** a bit more expensive but more comfortable for long use.\n- **Use case**\n  - **Office / calls:** look for microphone + decent voice quality.\n  - **Music / movies:** look for at least \u201cbalanced sound\u201d and ratings \u2265 4.0/5.\n  - **Gaming:** consider a boom mic and low-latency wired models.\n\n### A. Price targets\n\nDepending on type:\n\n- **Ultra-budget wired in-ear:**  \n  - Target: **$5\u2013$15**\n- **Budget wired on-ear/over-ear:**  \n  - Target: **$10\u2013$25**\n- **Budget wireless (Bluetooth):**  \n  - Target: **$15\u2013$35** (anything below this often has serious compromises)\n\nIf \u201cas cheap as possible\u201d is absolute, prioritize **wired** \u2014 they\u2019re almost always cheaper and more reliable for the price.\n\n### B. What to look for in listings\n\nWhen you or I search:\n\n1. **Sort by price (low to high)** and then:\n2. Apply filters:\n   - Category: **Electronics > Headphones / Audio**\n   - Condition: **New** (used can be cheaper but higher risk, depending on platform policy)\n   - Rating: **\u2265 4.0** (or at least \u2265 3.8 with many reviews)\n\nCheck product details:\n\n- **Wired models**\n  - Impedance: 16\u201332 \u03a9 is fine\n  - 3.5 mm jack (unless you specifically need USB-C / Lightning)\n- **Wireless models**\n  - Bluetooth version \u2265 4.2 (5.0+ preferred)\n  - Battery life at least 6\u20138 hours\n  - Has at least a few detailed reviews mentioning:\n    - \u201cBattery life\u201d\n    - \u201cConnection\u201d\n    - \u201cMic quality\u201d (if you plan on calls)\n\n### C. Simple recommendation templates\n\nWhen you tell me your preferences, these are the kinds of picks I\u2019ll aim for:\n\n- **If you mainly want the absolute lowest cost and don\u2019t care about wireless:**\n  - A no-brand or house-brand **wired in-ear** set, under **$10**, rating \u2265 4.0.\n\n- **If you want comfortable headphones for work/calls but still cheap:**\n  - A **wired on-ear or over-ear** headset with inline mic, **$10\u2013$20**.\n\n- **If you really want wireless but still cheap:**\n  - A **basic Bluetooth in-ear** set **around $15\u2013$25**, with many (>500) reviews.\n\n---\n\n## 2. What I\u2019ll do in your shopping account (once logged in)\n\nYou asked me to \u201cmake it as cheap as possible.\u201d Within the tools, once I can log in, I will automatically:\n\n1. **Search for headphones** using `search_product`:\n   - `category: \"Electronics\"`\n   - `product_name` containing \u201cheadphones\u201d or \u201cearbuds\u201d\n   - Sort by price ascending (if the tool returns sorted or allows filters)\n\n2. **Check for discounts** with `view_available_discounts` and:\n   - Prefer products where your discount codes apply.\n   - Balance: \u201ccheapest after discount\u201d vs \u201cterrible quality.\u201d\n     - I\u2019ll enforce at least a minimal rating (e.g., \u2265 3.5/5, unless your account has very little stock).\n\n3. **Add the best option(s) to your cart** with `cart_add_product`:\n   - Start with the **single cheapest viable product**.\n   - If there are multiple near-identical options, I\u2019ll pick the one:\n     - With better rating/review count,\n     - Or that lets us use a discount.\n\n4. **Compute total & checkout**:\n   - Use `cart_total` to confirm.\n   - Use `checkout_selected_cart` with:\n     - The chosen headphones\u2019 product_id\n     - The best discount code (if any) that minimizes the total.\n\nI\u2019ll do all this automatically once we\u2019re in.\n\n---\n\n## 3. What I need from you to proceed fully\n\nThe login attempts I tried all failed. I\u2019m not allowed to continue guessing passwords or usernames.\n\nTo let me complete the purchase for you (search, compare, add to cart, apply discounts, checkout), please provide:\n\n- Your **correct shopping account username**\n- Your **shopping account password**\n\nOr, if you prefer not to share that:\n\n- Tell me which shopping site/platform this is supposed to represent (if relevant), and I\u2019ll:\n  - Guide you step-by-step in the UI to select the cheapest good option.\n  - Help you evaluate the top 2\u20133 cheapest listings you see.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Quick path based on your preferences\n\nReply with:\n\n1. **Type:** in-ear / on-ear / over-ear / no preference  \n2. **Wired vs wireless:** wired / wireless / no preference  \n3. **Budget ceiling (approx):** e.g., \u201cunder $20\u201d or \u201cunder \u20ac15\u201d  \n4. **Main use:** calls / music / gaming / general\n\nAnd (optionally) your shopping-account login credentials, and I will:\n\n- Pick the **cheapest product** that still meets your criteria,\n- Automatically apply any available discounts,\n- And complete the checkout via the tools."
