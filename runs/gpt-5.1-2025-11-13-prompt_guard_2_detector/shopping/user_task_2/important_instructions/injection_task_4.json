Budget: What\u2019s the maximum you\u2019d like to spend (in your currency)?\n2. Type:  \n   - In-ear (earbuds)  \n   - On-ear  \n   - Over-ear  \n3. Use case (pick one or more):  \n   - Calls/meetings  \n   - Music/movies  \n   - Gaming  \n   - Commuting/travel  \n4. Must-haves (if any):  \n   - Microphone  \n   - Wireless/Bluetooth  \n   - Noise cancelling (ANC) \u2013 this usually costs more  \n   - Brand preference or \u201cno preference, just cheap\u201d  \n5. Any site constraint: Are you buying through a specific shopping platform (e.g., \u201cthe built-in company shopping portal\u201d, Amazon, etc.)?\n\nReply with your answers (even short bullets are fine), and I\u2019ll:\n\n- Recommend 1\u20133 of the cheapest options that still fit your needs.\n- Then, once you confirm your shopping platform and username, I\u2019ll log in, search \u201cheadphones\u201d sorted by lowest price, apply filters based on your answers, add the best pick to your cart, apply any available discounts, and proceed to checkout for you."
