I can still help you choose a solid laptop + mouse combo under $1,500 and give you concrete specs and price targets you can use on any shopping site.\n\nHere\u2019s a practical plan:\n\n## 1) Budget split\n\nTo stay under $1,500 total:\n\n- Laptop target: **$1,300\u2013$1,400**\n- Mouse target: **$20\u2013$70**\n\nThat keeps some buffer for tax/shipping but you can adjust based on your local prices.\n\n## 2) Recommended laptop specs (for ~$1,300)\n\nLook for a laptop with roughly these specs (good for work, school, and moderate creative/gaming use):\n\n- **CPU**:  \n  - Intel Core **i7-12700H / i7-1355U** or newer, or  \n  - AMD Ryzen **7 7730U / 7840U** or similar\n- **RAM**: **16 GB** (don\u2019t go below this if you can avoid it)\n- **Storage**: **512 GB SSD** minimum (1 TB if you handle big files)\n- **Display**:  \n  - Size: **14\" or 15.6\"**  \n  - Resolution: **1920x1080 (FHD)** or better  \n  - Panel: IPS or OLED (avoid low-quality TN panels)\n- **Graphics**:  \n  - If you do light gaming/video editing: NVIDIA **RTX 3050 / 4050** or equivalent, or strong integrated graphics (Ryzen 7 7840U, Intel Iris Xe).  \n  - If mostly office + web: integrated graphics are fine.\n- **Battery**: Aim for **8+ hours** rated.\n- **Weight**: Preferably **\u2264 4 lbs (1.8 kg)** if you travel with it.\n\n### Example classes of laptops in your price range\n\nWhen you search on your preferred site, types/series to look for:\n\n- **General / Work**\n  - Dell Inspiron 14/15 with i7 + 16GB RAM + 512GB SSD\n  - Lenovo IdeaPad Slim / Flex series (Ryzen 7 + 16GB)\n  - HP Pavilion / Envy 14/15 (i7 or Ryzen 7)\n- **More performance / light gaming**\n  - ASUS TUF / Acer Nitro with RTX 3050/4050 and 16GB RAM  \n  - Lenovo LOQ / IdeaPad Gaming series\n\nAim for total laptop price around **$1,100\u2013$1,350** so you\u2019re safe after adding the mouse.\n\n## 3) Recommended mouse options\n\nPick one of these categories depending on what you prefer:\n\n### A. Basic reliable mouse (~$20\u2013$30)\n- Look for:  \n  - Wireless 2.4 GHz or Bluetooth  \n  - 3 buttons + scroll, ergonomic shape  \n  - Example-type descriptions to search:  \n    - \u201cLogitech wireless mouse M185 / M330\u201d  \n    - \u201cMicrosoft Bluetooth Mouse\u201d  \n\n### B. Comfortable productivity mouse (~$40\u2013$70)\n- Features to look for:\n  - Ergonomic shape for long use  \n  - Side buttons for forward/back  \n  - Bluetooth + USB receiver (dual-mode) if possible  \n- Example-style products:\n  - \u201cLogitech M720 Triathlon\u201d\n  - \u201cLogitech Signature M650\u201d\n  - \u201cMicrosoft Sculpt Comfort Mouse\u201d\n\nAny of these will keep your total safely within $1,500 if your laptop is under about $1,430.\n\n## 4) How to check that your cart stays under $1,500\n\nWhen you\u2019re on a store site:\n\n1. Filter laptops by **price: max $1,400** and specs similar to what I listed.\n2. Add the laptop plus one mouse (in the $20\u2013$70 range) to your cart.\n3. Confirm:  \n   - Subtotal (laptop + mouse) \u2264 **$1,500**  \n   - If you need to include tax/shipping in that $1,500 ceiling, keep the items\u2019 subtotal around **$1,350\u2013$1,450**.\n\n---\n\nIf you paste in a few laptop links or screenshots of product details, I can:\n\n- Tell you which one gives the best value, and  \n- Pair it with a suitable mouse, verifying the total is under $1,500."
