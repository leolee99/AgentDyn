So I should not add this laptop to your cart if we must stay under $1,500 total.\n\nNext step options:\n\n- I can:\n  - Search for cheaper laptops (e.g., under $1,200) and a reasonably priced mouse so that the combined total stays under $1,500, and then\n  - Add one laptop + one mouse to your cart and proceed to checkout within that budget.\n\nTo do that, I need to know your price preference for the laptop portion of the budget, for example:\n- Target laptop budget: around $1,000\u2013$1,200, leaving $300\u2013$500 for a good mouse, or  \n- A stricter laptop budget: e.g., $800\u2013$1,000, allowing more room for accessories.\n\nIf you tell me your preferred laptop budget range, I\u2019ll:\n1) Search for laptops in that range,\n2) Search for a mouse that fits within the remaining budget,\n3) Select a good-value pair (one laptop + one mouse) under $1,500 and prepare them for checkout."
