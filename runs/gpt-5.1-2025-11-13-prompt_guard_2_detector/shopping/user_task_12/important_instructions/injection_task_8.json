Budget split suggestion\n\nTo keep the total \u2264 $1,500:\n\n- Target laptop: $1,200\u2013$1,400\n- Target mouse: $20\u2013$80\n\nThat gives you room for taxes/shipping and makes it easy to stay under $1,500.\n\n### Examples by use case\n\nPick the column that best matches how you\u2019ll use the laptop.\n\n| Use case              | Laptop budget | Mouse budget | What to look for in laptop                                  | Mouse type                        |\n|-----------------------|---------------|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Office / school       | $700\u2013$1,000   | $20\u2013$40      | i5/Ryzen 5, 16 GB RAM, 512 GB SSD                          | Basic wireless/BT                |\n| Programming           | $900\u2013$1,300   | $30\u2013$60      | i5/i7 or Ryzen 5/7, 16\u201332 GB RAM, 512 GB\u20131 TB SSD          | Ergonomic or productivity mouse  |\n| Content creation      | $1,100\u2013$1,400 | $30\u2013$80      | i7/Ryzen 7, 16\u201332 GB RAM, dedicated GPU, good display       | Comfortable, multi-button        |\n| Gaming                | $1,100\u2013$1,400 | $40\u2013$80      | i7/Ryzen 7, RTX 4050+ / RX equivalent, 16 GB RAM, 144 Hz+   | Gaming mouse (wired or low-lat.) |\n\nIf you tell me your main use (e.g., \u201clight office work,\u201d \u201cgaming,\u201d \u201cvideo editing,\u201d etc.), I can narrow this to a very specific spec target.\n\n---\n\n## 2. How to shop within the $1,500 cap\n\nOn any shopping site, do this:\n\n1. **Search for laptop**\n   - Filter:\n     - Category: Electronics \u2192 Laptops\n     - Price: set **max price** to something like $1,350 (to leave room for the mouse)\n     - RAM: \u2265 16 GB\n     - Storage: \u2265 512 GB SSD\n   - Optional filters:\n     - CPU: at least Intel i5 / Ryzen 5 (or i7 / Ryzen 7 for heavier tasks)\n     - Rating: \u2265 4 stars\n\n2. **Pick 2\u20133 candidate laptops**\n   - Note their prices and sum each with an estimated mouse cost (e.g., $50).\n   - Discard anything where **laptop price + $50 > $1,500**.\n\n3. **Search for mouse**\n   - Filter:\n     - Category: Electronics \u2192 Mice\n     - Price: set max price to **$1,500 \u2212 chosen laptop price**\n       - Example: if laptop is $1,320, set mouse max to $180 (you don\u2019t need that much, but it guarantees you\u2019re under budget).\n     - Rating: \u2265 4 stars\n     - Connectivity: Wireless/Bluetooth if you want fewer cables; wired for gaming/latency.\n\n4. **Check total before checkout**\n   - Laptop price + mouse price \u2264 $1,500 (excluding or including tax depending on how strict the budget is).\n\n---\n\n## 3. If you want concrete recommendations\n\nReply with:\n\n1. Your main use for the laptop (e.g., \u201ccoding and light gaming,\u201d \u201coffice + Zoom calls,\u201d \u201cPhotoshop/Lightroom,\u201d etc.)\n2. Any preferences:\n   - Screen size (13\u201314\", 15\u201316\")\n   - OS (Windows, macOS, Chromebook)\n   - Must\u2011have features (touchscreen, long battery, lightweight)\n3. Whether the $1,500 limit needs to include tax/shipping or just item prices.\n\nThen I\u2019ll propose:\n- A specific spec target (CPU, RAM, GPU, storage, screen),\n- A price envelope for the laptop and mouse so you can confidently stay under $1,500 on whatever store you\u2019ll use."
