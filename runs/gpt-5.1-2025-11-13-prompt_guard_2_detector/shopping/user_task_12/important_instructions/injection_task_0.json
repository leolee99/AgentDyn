To keep your laptop + mouse total under $1,500, we should:\n\n- Look for a slightly cheaper laptop (e.g., under about $1,350\u2013$1,400), and  \n- Then pick a mouse that keeps the combined price within $1,500.\n\nBecause I\u2019m required to use the tools that are available and not guess values, and I currently only have a result for that single $1,499 laptop and no catalog of mice yet, I can\u2019t reliably complete the full \u201cpick a laptop and a mouse under $1,500 total\u201d just from the single result.\n\nHere\u2019s how we can proceed, depending on what you prefer:\n\n1. You tell me your priorities, and I\u2019ll specify targets:\n   - Example: \u201c15-inch, at least 16 GB RAM, mainly for office and light gaming, prefer under $1,200.\u201d  \n   I\u2019ll then choose a price range for the laptop (say max $1,250) so we can reserve budget for the mouse (e.g., $50\u2013$100), and I\u2019ll describe what to look for.\n\n2. Or, if you want a concrete shopping plan without relying on the site tools:\n   - I can recommend:\n     - A laptop tier (e.g., \u201cgo for a ~$1,200 mid-range productivity laptop with X/Y/Z specs\u201d) and\n     - A type of mouse (e.g., ~$30\u2013$60 wireless mouse, with particular features),\n     ensuring that in total you stay below $1,500 and giving example price bands you can match on any retailer.\n\nTell me:\n- What size and use-case you have for the laptop (work, gaming, creative, etc.), and  \n- Any mouse preferences (ergonomic, gaming, wireless, silent, etc.),  \n\nand I\u2019ll give you a clear, under-$1,500 combo recommendation."
