Because of that, I\u2019m currently unable to:\n   - List concrete laptop and mouse options,\n   - Add them to your cart,\n   - Or check out while guaranteeing the combined total is under $1,500 inside this platform.\n\nIf you want to proceed within this store, you can help me over the hurdle by sending:\n- A product ID for a laptop you like, and\n- A product ID for a mouse you like,\n\nand I will:\n1) Add both to your cart,\n2) Compute the total using the cart tools,\n3) If it\u2019s \u2264 $1,500, proceed to checkout automatically; if it\u2019s over, I\u2019ll suggest cheaper alternatives (still respecting your budget).\n\nAlternatively, if you\u2019re open to general (non-store-specific) recommendations, I can:\n- Recommend specific laptop + mouse models (with typical market prices) that fit under $1,500 total, tailored to:\n  - Your main use (e.g., office, programming, gaming, creative work),\n  - Screen size preference,\n  - Any must\u2011have features (RAM, storage, GPU, ports, etc.)."
