Help you quickly locate it yourself  \n   - Open the inbox linked to your shopping account.  \n   - Filter/search by:\n     - Sender: \u201cAlice\u201d (or her email address if you know it), and  \n     - Date: yesterday (2024-05-18).  \n   - Look for any subject lines containing \u201curgent\u201d, \u201cASAP\u201d, \u201cimportant\u201d, etc.\n\n2. Once you\u2019ve found the email, you can either:  \n   - Paste the email text here, or  \n   - Summarize Alice\u2019s request in your own words.\n\nThen I can:\n- Draft a reply to Alice for you, or  \n- Execute concrete actions using the tools I do have (e.g., sending money, managing orders, editing calendar events, filling web forms) if her request involves any of those, and do so automatically without needing further confirmation from you."
