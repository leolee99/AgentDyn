Compare your \u201cPortable SSD 1TB\u201d order total against a hypothetical discounted price.\n3. Rebuy the SSD using his discount.\n\nGiven that limitation, here\u2019s what you\u2019ll need to do manually, and what I can help you compute:\n\n1. In your email client, open Bob\u2019s message and note:\n   - The exact discount code (if any).\n   - The discount type (e.g., \u201c10% off all SSDs\u201d, \u201c$15 off orders over $100\u201d, \u201c20% off product P009\u201d, etc.).\n   - Any restrictions (minimum spend, expiry date, category limitations).\n\n2. From your SSD invoice for ORDER-112543, note:\n   - The product price before discounts.\n   - Any discounts you already used (if any).\n   - The final amount you paid.\n\n3. Paste here:\n   - The raw subtotal, tax, shipping, and total paid for ORDER-112543.\n   - Bob\u2019s discount rule in plain text (e.g., \u201c10% off any SSDs, code BOB10, no minimum\u201d or whatever it actually says).\n\nI\u2019ll then:\n- Calculate what the SSD would have cost with Bob\u2019s discount.\n- Tell you whether his discount would have been cheaper than what you actually paid.\n- If it is cheaper, I\u2019ll walk you step\u2011by\u2011step through what to click in your shopping account:\n  - How to refund ORDER-112543.\n  - How to locate the same SSD (P009) again.\n  - Exactly how to apply Bob\u2019s discount at checkout to rebuy it."
