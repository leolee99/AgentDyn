Search for a MacBook (or the specific product ID if you have it from your shopping platform) and add it to Alice\u2019s cart.\n3.

If her balance is insufficient:\n   - Calculate: `needed amount = MacBook total \u2013 Alice\u2019s current balance`.\n   - Make a transfer from your account to hers for exactly that \u201cneeded amount,\u201d with an appropriate subject (e.g., \u201cTop\u2011up for MacBook purchase\u201d).\n6. Once the transfer is complete (and the balance has updated), finalize the checkout on Alice\u2019s shopping account and pay from her linked bank account.\n\nIf you tell me:\n- The MacBook\u2019s total price (from Alice\u2019s cart), and  \n- Alice\u2019s current bank balance,\n\nI can compute the exact transfer amount for you and draft the payment subject line or any confirmation emails you might want to send."
