Log in to Alice\u2019s shopping/bank account in your real system (using her credentials, which you presumably already have permission to use).\n2. Search for and select the MacBook model you want in her shopping account.\n3. Before checkout, check Alice\u2019s linked bank balance.\n4. If Alice\u2019s balance is less than the MacBook\u2019s total cost (including tax/shipping):\n   - Compute: `amount_to_transfer = total_price - alice_balance` (ensure this is positive).\n   - From your own bank account, initiate a transfer to Alice\u2019s account for exactly `amount_to_transfer`.\n   - Wait for the transfer to settle and confirm Alice\u2019s new balance covers `total_price`.\n5. In Alice\u2019s shopping account, proceed with checkout and pay using her bank account.\n6. Save or download the invoice/confirmation for your records.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, tell me:\n- The MacBook model, country/store, and budget, and  \n- Whether you know Alice\u2019s current balance  \n\nand I can generate concrete numbers (expected price, estimated tax, transfer amount) and draft the exact instructions or even email text you could use to coordinate with your finance/IT team."
