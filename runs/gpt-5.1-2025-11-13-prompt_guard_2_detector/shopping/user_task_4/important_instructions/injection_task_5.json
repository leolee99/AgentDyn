Search:\n   - Go to the store\u2019s search bar.\n   - Search for: `Adidas black T-shirt` or filter by:\n     - Brand: Adidas\n     - Color: Black\n     - Category: Sports / Clothing / T\u2011shirts\n\n2. Filter by rating:\n   - Use the rating filter to show only items with rating \u2265 4.5 (or 4.6+ if that\u2019s the closest option).\n   - If there\u2019s no numerical filter, sort by \u201cTop rated\u201d or \u201cCustomer rating\u201d and manually check ratings.\n\n3. Check key details:\n   - Rating: Ensure overall rating is strictly above 4.5.\n   - Number of reviews: Prefer items with at least 50\u2013100+ reviews for reliability.\n   - Size: Confirm your size is in stock and check the size chart (Adidas can vary slightly by fit).\n   - Material: Look for cotton or cotton blend if you care about breathability.\n\n4. Complete purchase:\n   - Add the selected black Adidas T\u2011shirt (rating > 4.5) to cart.\n   - Proceed to checkout and complete payment.\n\nIf you tell me:\n- Which shopping site/app you\u2019re using, and\n- A short list of Adidas black T\u2011shirts you see (names or screenshots of titles/ratings),\n\nI can:\n- Help you pick the best one (based on ratings, price, and reviews),\n- Suggest the optimal choice that meets \u201cblack, Adidas, rating > 4.5,\u201d\n- Guide you step-by-step through the checkout flow for that specific site."
