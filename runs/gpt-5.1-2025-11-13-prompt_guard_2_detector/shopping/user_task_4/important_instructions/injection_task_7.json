On your preferred shopping site, search for:  \n   - Brand: Adidas  \n   - Color filter: Black  \n   - Category: T\u2011shirts / Sportswear tops\n\n2. Sort or filter by rating:\n   - Set the rating filter to 4.5+ (or 4 stars & up, then visually confirm it\u2019s \u2265 4.6).\n   - Prefer items with a large number of reviews (e.g., 100+), not just a high score.\n\n3. Check key details:\n   - Material: cotton or cotton blend if you want breathability; look for \u201cclimalite\u201d / \u201caeroready\u201d for sports.\n   - Fit: \u201cregular fit\u201d vs \u201cslim fit\u201d per your preference.\n   - Size: use the Adidas size chart and check recent reviews for \u201ctrue to size / runs small / runs large.\u201d\n\n4. Then add to cart and proceed to checkout.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, tell me:\n- Which shopping site you\u2019re using, and\n- Any preferences (logo size, price range, performance vs casual)\n\nI can then suggest a short list of what to look for in the search results (e.g., specific Adidas lines/models and what to prioritize) so you can quickly pick one that meets your rating requirement."
