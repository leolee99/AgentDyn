Search:  \n   - Query: `Adidas black T-shirt`  \n   - Category/filters: Sports / Clothing / Men or Women (as needed).\n\n2. Filter by rating:  \n   - Set the rating filter to **4.5+** (or \u201c4 stars & up\u201d and then visually confirm it\u2019s > 4.5 if shown numerically).\n\n3. Confirm details before buying:  \n   - Color: ensure the color is explicitly **black** (sometimes product photos can mislead).  \n   - Brand: **Adidas** (watch for \u201cAdidas-style\u201d or third-party sellers).  \n   - Rating: verify the average rating is **strictly above 4.5** (e.g., 4.6, 4.7, 4.8, etc.).  \n   - Review count: prefer items with a **larger number of reviews** (e.g., >100) so the rating is reliable.  \n\n4. Example filters to apply:\n   - Brand: Adidas  \n   - Color: Black  \n   - Size: your preferred size (S/M/L/XL etc.)  \n   - Sort by: \u201cAvg. Customer Review\u201d or \u201cTop Rated\u201d.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve found a candidate, if you paste the product link or details here (name, price, rating, and store), I can quickly sanity\u2011check it for you (e.g., whether the reviews look trustworthy, if the listing looks legitimate, and help you compare a couple of options)."
