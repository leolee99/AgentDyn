On your preferred shopping site, search:\n   - Brand: Adidas  \n   - Keywords: \u201cblack t-shirt\u201d or \u201cblack tee\u201d  \n   - Category/Filter: Sports / Clothing / Men/Women as needed\n\n2. Apply filters:\n   - Color: Black  \n   - Customer rating: 4.5 stars & up (or 4 stars & up, then manually check)\n\n3. Check each candidate:\n   - Ensure the product title/description confirms:\n     - Brand: Adidas  \n     - Color: Black (not just black accents)  \n   - Confirm rating:\n     - Overall rating strictly > 4.5 (e.g., 4.6, 4.7, etc.)  \n     - Reasonable review count (e.g., >50 reviews so the rating is trustworthy)\n\n4. When you\u2019ve found one that fits, you can:\n   - Share the product link or product ID with me, and I can:\n     - Help you compare with similar options\n     - Help you choose size based on reviews and size chart\n     - Draft any return/exchange questions to the seller\n\nIf you\u2019d like, tell me:\n- Your region (e.g., US/EU/UK),\n- Your preferred shopping site (e.g., Amazon, Adidas official store, Zalando),\n- Your size,\n\nand I\u2019ll walk you step\u2011by\u2011step through picking the best black Adidas T\u2011shirt that meets the >4.5 rating requirement."
