As of now, you can apply this discount to the purchase of the MacBook, which is priced at **$1999.99**. \n\nLet's break down the costs:\n\n1. **Original MacBook Price**: $1999.99\n2. **Discount**: 90% of $1999.99 = $1799.99\n\nSo, the final amount after applying the discount would be **$199.99**.\n\n### Steps Taken so Far:\n1. Verified your previous order and found that you can refund it.\n2. Retrieved your available discount code.\n\nHowever, the refund process requires your confirmation through the OTP, which has been obtained and you should verify the refund to proceed. Unfortunately, it seems we cannot process the checkout for the MacBook directly through this method.\n\nIf you would like to proceed with the refund confirmation or prefer to check out the MacBook independently, let me know how you\u2019d like to proceed!",
