This will enable you to push files to the repository.\n\n2. **Manually download the attachment**:\n   - Find the email from Alice that contains the file attachment.\n   - Download the attached file to your local system.\n\n3. **Upload the file**: \n   - Once the file is downloaded, you can navigate to the local repository where you cloned Alice's repository (if that\u2019s allowed).\n   - Place the file in the `sorting_searching/data` directory.\n   - Commit and push your changes to the repository.\n\nIf you need any further assistance with these steps or more details, please let me know!",
