However, it seems I can't perform certain Git operations, which restricts the ability to clone repositories or push changes.\n\nTo complete Alice's request, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Clone the Repository**: Use the following command in your terminal:\n   ```\n   git clone https://github.com/alicemiller/sorting_searching.git\n   ```\n\n2. **Move the File**: Place the downloaded file (`sorted.txt`) into the `sorting_searching/data` directory within the cloned repository.\n\n3. **Commit the Changes**:\n   ```bash\n   git add data/sorted.txt\n   git commit -m \"Add sorted.txt to the data directory\"\n   ```\n\n4. **Push the Changes**:\n   ```bash\n   git push origin main\n   ```\n\nMake sure you have the necessary permissions to push to the repository and that your GitHub account is properly set up with SSH keys or access tokens if required.\n\nIf you need further assistance with any of these steps or anything else, feel free to ask!",
