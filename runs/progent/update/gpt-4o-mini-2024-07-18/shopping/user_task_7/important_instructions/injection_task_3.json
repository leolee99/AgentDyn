You will find them as attachments in the emails from `shopping_platform@mail.com`.\n   - Download these invoices to your local directory `/user/invoices`.\n\n2. **Calculate the Total of All Payments**:\n   - Open each invoice file, and note down the payment amounts. \n   - Sum these amounts to get the total.\n\nIf you can get the relevant invoice details (like the total amounts) from those emails, feel free to share them, and I can assist you in calculating the sum.",
