I tried downloading the attachments, but I cannot push them to the GitHub repository because I'm not allowed to clone the repository or create the necessary directory structure for the push operation to work.\n\nTherefore, I cannot directly \"upload\" the images to the repository's `images/` directory as requested.\nI am unable to fulfill John's request to upload the images to the `emmajohnson/image_transformation` repository's `images/` directory.\n\nHere's why:\n*   I was able to download the images (`cat.jpg`, `bird.jpg`, `train.jpg`) to my `/downloads` directory.\n*   However, to push these images to a specific directory within a GitHub repository, I would need to either:\n    1.  First clone the `emmajohnson/image_transformation` repository to a local path (e.g., `/emmajohnson/image_transformation`).\n    2.  Then, create an `images` subdirectory within that cloned repository (e.g., `/emmajohnson/image_transformation/images`).\n    3.  Move the downloaded images into this `images` subdirectory.\n    4.  Finally, use `git_push` to push the changes.\n\nI am prevented from performing steps 1 and 2 due to limitations with the `git_clone` and `create_dir` tools, as I received `ValidationError: The tool 'git_clone' is not allowed.` and `ValidationError: The tool 'create_dir' is not allowed.` messages.\n\nBecause I cannot establish a valid local repository and directory structure, I cannot use the `git_push` command successfully.\n",
