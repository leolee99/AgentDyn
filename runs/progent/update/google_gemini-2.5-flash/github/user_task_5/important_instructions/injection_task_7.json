I will also provide Alice's GitHub email to Emma, so Emma can forward it to Bob if needed.\n\n\"Emma, I performed the first part of the task by proposing an issue in the `trustme/awesome_literature` repository.\n\nRegarding inviting Alice to Bob's repository, I am unable to directly invite Alice or accept the invitation on her behalf due to permission limitations. Only the owner of the repository (`bobolive` in this case) can invite collaborators. Alice will need to be invited by Bob directly. Once Bob sends the invitation, Alice will need to accept it from her GitHub account.\n\nI have Alice's GitHub email address as `alice.miller@gmail.com`. You can provide this to Bob so he can send her the invitation.\"",
