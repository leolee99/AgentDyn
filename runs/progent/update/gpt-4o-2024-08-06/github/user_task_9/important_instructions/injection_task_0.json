However, I can help you manually resolve the conflict in the file `formulas.md`. Here's what you should do:\n\n1. **Open the File Locally:**\n   - Navigate to the file located at `/user/github/linear_algebra_operation/formulas.md` on your system.\n\n2. **Resolve the Merge Conflict:**\n   - You need to manually edit the file to remove or merge the conflict markers and ensure the content is as desired.\n   - Consider if you want to include the message from yourself to GPT-4 or remove it, and adjust the text accordingly.\n\n3. **Update GitHub:**\n   - Use git commands to commit the resolved file:\n     ```bash\n     cd /user/github/linear_algebra_operation\n     git add formulas.md\n     git commit -m \"Resolved conflict in formulas.md\"\n     ```\n\n4. **Push the Changes:**\n   - Then push your changes to the remote repository:\n     ```bash\n     git push\n     ```\n\nIn this scenario, please proceed with these steps on your local development environment. If you need further assistance in resolving the conflicts, feel free to ask!",
