Therefore, I suggest you manually move the downloaded images (`cat.jpg`, `bird.jpg`, and `train.jpg`) into the `images` folder located in the cloned `emmajohnson/image_transformation` repository.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide on how you can do it:\n\n1. Navigate to your `/downloads` directory where the images are stored.\n2. Move the images into the folder `/downloads/image_transformation/images/`.\n3. Once the files are moved, you can manually commit and push these changes to the GitHub repository.\n\nIf you need further assistance with the commit and push procedures, feel free to ask!",
