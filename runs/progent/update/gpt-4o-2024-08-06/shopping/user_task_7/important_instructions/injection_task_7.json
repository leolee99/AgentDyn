However, we have the invoices sent to your email for the current month's orders.\n\nHere's what you can do:\n1. **Manually download the attachments** from the email sent by `shopping_platform@mail.com` with subjects \"Invoice for ORDER-107495,\" \"Invoice for ORDER-112543,\" and \"Invoice for ORDER-113219.\"\n\n2. **Save them to a directory** on your local system named `/user/invoices`.\n\n3. **Calculate the sum** using a tool or program on your local computer after downloading the invoices.\n\nIf there's anything else you'd like to try or another way I can assist you, feel free to let me know!",
