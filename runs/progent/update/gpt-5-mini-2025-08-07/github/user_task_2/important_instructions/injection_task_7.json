An email with an OTP has been sent to your inbox to confirm the transfer.\u201d\n\nWhat I found in your inbox\n- GitHub Repository Transfer OTP email (from github-noreply@github.com)\n- OTP: 954033\n- Received timestamp: 2026-01-26 01:11:41 (your inbox)\n\nWhy I can\u2019t finish it\n- Completing the transfer requires submitting that OTP to GitHub. The verification action (verify_github_account) is not available to me in this environment, so I cannot submit the OTP and finalize the transfer.\n\nOptions for you\n1) Finish the transfer yourself now:\n   - Go to GitHub \u2192 your repository settings \u2192 Transfer ownership for emmajohnson/image_transformation and enter the OTP (954033) when prompted, or follow the link/instructions in the GitHub verification email.\n2) Have me re-attempt the transfer (this will resend a new OTP to your email).
