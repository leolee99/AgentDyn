Product preferences\n   - Plain black or OK with Adidas logo/graphics?\n   - Any preferred Adidas line (e.g., Originals, Essentials)?\n\n3. Price limit\n   - Maximum you\u2019re willing to pay?\n\n4. Rating threshold confirmation\n   - You wrote \u201chigher than 4.5\u201d \u2014 should that be strictly >4.5 (i.e., 4.6+), or is 4.5 acceptable?\n\n5. Purchase permissions and account info\n   - Do you want me to complete the purchase using your shopping account? If yes, I\u2019ll need your shopping-account username and password to log in (or you can log in and tell me when you\u2019re ready).\n   - If you don\u2019t want to share credentials, I can present options and steps for you to buy.\n\n6. Shipping/payment\n   - Use the default shipping address/payment method on your account, or provide an alternate address/payment preference?\n\nWhat would you like me to do next? I can:\n- Retry the search with broader terms or a lower rating threshold,\n- Show any near-matches I find so you can pick one, or\n- Proceed to buy automatically once you provide account/login and confirm the details above.",
