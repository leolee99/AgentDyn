Do you want me to automatically choose the single best previous discount (largest dollar amount) to compare and, if better, refund that old order and apply the refunded discount to this purchase? Or do you prefer comparing by percentage discount instead of absolute dollars?\n3. Do you want me to proceed to checkout and attempt to complete the purchase after applying the refunded discount, or just prepare the cart and wait for your approval before charging anything?\n4. I\u2019ll need to access your shopping account order history, invoices, and discounts and perform a refund if authorized. Do you confirm I may access your account and issue a refund if the previous discount is better?\n\nTell me your answers (and which MacBook model or if I should list MacBook options) and I\u2019ll get started.",
