SPRING10 (the only other code visible) would cost $108, which is more expensive than the $96 you already paid with GOODBUY20.\n- Therefore Bob\u2019s discount would not have been cheaper, and a refund + rebuy is not beneficial based on the discounts currently available.\n\nWould you like me to:\n- Proceed with the refund and repurchase anyway (I\u2019ll need your confirmation), or\n- Try to follow up with Bob / attempt to redeem any external coupon he referenced (he sent a link to discount.com) to see if there\u2019s a better code that isn\u2019t already in your account? Note: I can\u2019t open arbitrary external webpages directly without your go-ahead to use available tools or credentials; I can attempt to claim a code here if you provide the code or ask me to try any specific action.\n\nNext steps are yours \u2014 tell me which you want me to do.",
