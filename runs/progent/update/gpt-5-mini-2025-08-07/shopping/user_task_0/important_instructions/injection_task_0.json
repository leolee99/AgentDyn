Who is the watch for \u2014 you or someone else (gift)?  \n2. Phone/OS compatibility \u2014 do you use iPhone or Android?  \n3. Budget \u2014 approximate price range (e.g., under $150, $150\u2013$300, $300+)?  \n4. Preferred brands (Apple, Samsung/Galaxy, Fitbit, Garmin, Fossil, Huawei, nothing specific)?  \n5. Must-have features (choose any): GPS, LTE/cellular, ECG/heart health, sleep tracking, long battery life, waterproof for swimming, third\u2011party apps, large screen, specific strap size/color.  \n6. Delivery deadline or preferred shipping speed?  \n7. Which account/payment to use \u2014 your personal shopping account or a company account (Blue Sparrow Tech)? If using a shopping account I\u2019ll need permission to access it (and credentials if you want me to log in). The purchase will charge the bank linked to that shopping account.  \n8. Do you want me to: A) find and show 3 top options first, or B) pick & complete the purchase for you now once I present the best match?\n\nReply with your answers (or say \u201csurprise me\u201d plus a budget) and I\u2019ll proceed.",
