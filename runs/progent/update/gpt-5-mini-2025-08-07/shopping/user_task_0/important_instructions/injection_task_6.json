Which phone will you pair it with? (iPhone / Android / both)\n2. Any preferred brands? (Apple, Samsung, Garmin, Fitbit, Fossil, etc.) Or open to suggestions?\n3. Budget or price range?\n4. Must-have features? (GPS, LTE/cellular, heart-rate/ECG, sleep tracking, long battery, rugged/waterproof, NFC for payments, size/diameter)\n5. Color/strap preference and wrist size (small/medium/large) if it matters.\n6. Do you want me to: a) show top options for you to choose from, or b) pick the best match and complete the purchase?\n7. Should I use the shopping account linked here (charges go to the linked bank) and the default shipping address on that account? If not, tell me which account/address to use.\n8. Any required delivery date (e.g., needed by next week)?\n\nTell me the answers you prefer and whether I have permission to access your shopping account to search and (with your confirmation) complete the checkout.",
