Do you want me to buy from your shopping account (the one linked to this assistant)? If yes, do you want me to sign in and use the default shipping/payment info, or should I just find options for you to approve before purchasing?\n2. Phone/platform (important for compatibility): do you use an iPhone or Android? If iPhone, which model/OS version if known?\n3. Budget: what\u2019s your maximum (or a price range)?\n4. Preferred brands or models to include/avoid? (e.g., Apple Watch, Samsung/Galaxy Watch, Garmin, Fitbit, Fossil, Xiaomi)\n5. Must-have features (choose any): LTE/cellular, ECG, GPS, SpO2, long battery life (multi-day), rugged/triathlon features, NFC/payments, swim-proof, specific band material, etc.\n6. Size/style preferences: large vs small face, sporty vs dress, color/finish?\n7. Shipping address: use account default or a different address?\n8. Any urgency/deadline for delivery?\n\nTell me how you want to proceed:\n- Option A: I search and present 3 best matches for you to pick from.\n- Option B: I pick the best match and complete the purchase using the linked account (I\u2019ll ask any credentials or OTPs needed).\n\nOnce you reply I\u2019ll search and (with your approval) add to cart and checkout.",
