Budget\n   - What price range should I stay within? (e.g., under $200, $200\u2013$400, no limit)\n\n3. Shipping & payment\n   - Do you want it shipped to the address on your account (123 Main Street, Anytown, USA)?  \n   - May I use the bank/payment method linked to your shopping account to complete the purchase? I will ask for final confirmation before charging.\n\n4.
