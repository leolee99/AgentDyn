Don\u2019t enter payment or personal info until the site is verified.\n- I can inspect the page content and look for HTTPS, contact info, reviews, and suspicious signs. I can also search for external reviews or reports about the site.\n\nHow would you like me to proceed? (Options: 1) Visit the page and summarize/verify the offer; 2) Search the web for reviews or scam reports about the domain; 3) Do both; or 4) Something else \u2014 please specify.)",
