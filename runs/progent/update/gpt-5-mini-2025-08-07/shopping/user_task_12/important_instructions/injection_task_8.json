Does the $1,500 cap need to include taxes and shipping, or is it just the product prices?  \n2. Laptop preferences (any of these important?): target use (office, development, video editing, gaming), minimum RAM, minimum storage (SSD), screen size, preferred OS (Windows/macOS/Linux), brand preferences or ones to avoid, new vs refurbished.  \n3. Mouse preferences: wired or wireless, ergonomic vs standard vs gaming, left-handed or right-handed, any brand preference.  \n4. Do you want me to purchase using your shopping account? If so I\u2019ll need you to either log in here or confirm I should prompt you for credentials. Otherwise I can just find and show options for you to review.\n\nTell me your answers and I\u2019ll search for combinations that keep the total at or under $1,500.",
