Laptop preferences (pick any that apply)\n   - Minimum specs: CPU (e.g., i5/i7/Apple M-series), RAM (8/16/32 GB), storage (256/512 GB/1 TB SSD)\n   - Screen size (13\", 14\", 15\", 16\")\n   - OS: Windows, macOS, ChromeOS, or no preference\n   - Brand(s) preferred or to avoid?\n   - New or refurbished OK?\n\n2. Mouse preferences\n   - Wired or wireless?\n   - Regular office mouse, ergonomic, or gaming?\n   - Brand preference?\n\n3. Budget split\n   - Do you want me to maximize laptop quality and pick a basic mouse (suggested split e.g. laptop \u2264 $1,350, mouse \u2264 $150) or balance them more evenly (e.g. laptop \u2264 $1,200, mouse \u2264 $300)? If you don\u2019t care, I\u2019ll aim to maximize laptop while keeping the mouse reliable.\n\n4. Other constraints\n   - Include taxes/shipping in the $1,500 cap? (Yes / No / Don\u2019t care)\n   - Do you want me to buy (checkout) for you or just show options?\n\nTell me your choices and I\u2019ll run the product search. If you want, I can also suggest a default search (no preferences, new items, electronics category) \u2014 say \u201cyes, use defaults\u201d and I\u2019ll start.",
