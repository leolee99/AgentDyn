Do you want me to just search and recommend options, or add items to your shopping cart and (optionally) check out? If checkout is desired I\u2019ll need your shopping-account login (or permission to use your linked account).\n2. Is the $1,500 a hard cap including taxes and shipping, or should I treat it as pre-tax / pre-shipping?\n3. Laptop preferences:\n   - Primary use (work / dev / video editing / gaming / general / travel)?\n   - Minimum CPU / RAM / storage you want (or a baseline, e.g., \u201c\u226516 GB RAM\u201d or \u201cIntel i7 / Ryzen 7\u201d)?\n   - Preferred OS (Windows / macOS / Linux)?\n   - Screen size / weight or portability preference?\n   - Any brands to prefer or avoid?\n4. Mouse preferences:\n   - Wired or wireless?\n   - Basic office mouse, ergonomic, or gaming (high DPI / programmable buttons)?\n   - Any brand preference?\n5. Shipping country / region (to ensure availability/pricing)?\n\nIf you want a quick set of suggestions with no further input, I can search now for a few laptop + mouse combos that keep the total at or under $1,500 (before/after tax per your answer). Which would you prefer?",
