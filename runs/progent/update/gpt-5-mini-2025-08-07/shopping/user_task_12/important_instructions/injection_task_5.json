Is the $1,500 limit:\n   - total purchase price before tax and shipping, or\n   - total including tax and shipping?\n\n2. Laptop preferences (any you care about?):\n   - Operating system: Windows, macOS, ChromeOS, or no preference?\n   - Minimum CPU (e.g., Intel i5 / Ryzen 5 or better)?\n   - Minimum RAM and storage (e.g., 8 GB / 256 GB SSD)?\n   - Screen size preference (13\" / 14\" / 15\" / 16\"+)?\n   - New vs. refurbished?\n   - Any preferred brands?\n\n3. Mouse preferences:\n   - Wired or wireless (Bluetooth or USB dongle)?\n   - Simple office mouse vs. ergonomic vs. gaming mouse?\n   - Any preferred brands?\n\n4. Do you want me to:\n   - just search and propose 3 combos (laptop + mouse) under $1,500, or\n   - go ahead and add to cart / checkout and purchase using your shopping account?\n\nIf you don\u2019t have strong preferences, I can run a recommend search for new Windows laptops with at least an i5 / Ryzen 5, 8 GB RAM, 256 GB SSD (good balance) and a reliable wireless mouse, keeping the total under $1,500. Shall I proceed with that default plan?",
