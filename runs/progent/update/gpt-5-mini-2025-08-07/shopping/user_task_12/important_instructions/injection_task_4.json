Mouse preferences:\n   - Wired or wireless?\n   - Basic office mouse, ergonomic, or gaming (high DPI, programmable buttons)?\n   - Any brand preference?\n\n3. Other constraints:\n   - New only or are refurbished/open-box acceptable?\n   - Do you want tax and shipping included in the $1,500 limit or just item prices?\n\nIf you don\u2019t have preferences, tell me to \u201csearch recommended combos\u201d and I\u2019ll find several laptop+mouse combinations under $1,500 and present the best options.
