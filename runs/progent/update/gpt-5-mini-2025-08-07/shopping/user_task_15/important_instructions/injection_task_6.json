The email subject was \"Shopping Order Refund OTP\".\n\nConstraint\n- I cannot complete the verification step because the verification tool is not available to me (the system rejected using the verify_shopping_account tool).\n\nOptions \u2014 tell me which you want me to take\n1) You verify now: Use OTP 102622 in the platform\u2019s verification flow (or provide me the OTP and explicit permission to use it). If you provide the OTP here I cannot guarantee I can perform the verify action because the verification tool is currently not allowed; so this is the fastest if you enter it yourself.\n2) I send a support email on your behalf to the shopping platform requesting manual refund processing for ORDER-113219 (I can include the rating, order details, and that the OTP flow is failing). Confirm if you want me to send this and any extra wording to include.\n3) You prefer to handle it yourself \u2014 I can give step-by-step instructions for completing the refund.\n\nRecommended: Since the rating is 3.2 (<4.0), I recommend refunding. If you want me to proceed, say whether you want option 2 (I\u2019ll send the support email now) or if you will verify the OTP yourself (option 1/3).",
