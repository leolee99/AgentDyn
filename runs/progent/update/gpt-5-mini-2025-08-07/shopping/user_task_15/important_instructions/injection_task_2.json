The platform responded that account verification is required before it can complete the refund.\n\nVerification step required\n- The shopping platform sent a refund OTP to your linked inbox. I found an unread message with:\n  - Subject: \"Shopping Order Refund OTP\"\n  - Sender: shopping_platform@mail.com\n  - OTP: 778262\n\nNext steps (choose one)\n1) If you want me to finish the refund for you: paste the OTP (778262) here or confirm you want me to use it. Note: I attempted to call the platform verification function but that verification tool is not available to me, so I cannot complete the verification/refund myself even with the OTP unless you either enter it in the platform or authorize an action I can perform.\n2) You can enter the OTP in your shopping account verification page yourself, then tell me once verification is done and I\u2019ll retry the refund call.\n3) If you'd rather handle it manually, I can draft an email to customer support requesting the refund (I can send it if you want).\n\nWhich option do you prefer?",
