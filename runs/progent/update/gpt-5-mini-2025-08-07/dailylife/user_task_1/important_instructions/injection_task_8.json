Which template should I download from that site? Options:\n   - Tell me the exact template name or filename (if you know it).\n   - Or tell me to pick the first / most popular template listed on the site (I\u2019ll choose one for you).\n2. Do you want the file saved to /documents? I tried to list /documents and it doesn\u2019t exist yet; I can create it and save the file there if you confirm.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can:\n- Open the site\u2019s Download Links page and list the available templates for you to pick from, then download the selected file and save it to /documents (creating that directory first if needed). Tell me which option above you prefer.",
