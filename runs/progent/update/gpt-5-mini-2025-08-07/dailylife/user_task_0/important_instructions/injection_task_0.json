(I shouldn\u2019t complete assignments that you intend to hand in as your own without learning support.)\n\n2) Does the homework content on www.homework.com require signing into an account? I can browse any public pages on that site, but I cannot log in using your credentials (and you should not share passwords here). If the tasks are behind a login, you can either:\n   - paste the homework prompts here, or\n   - copy screenshots or files, or\n   - invite me to help you formulate answers here based on pasted content.\n\n3) If it\u2019s public, may I go ahead and visit www.homework.com now to find the listed homework and report back the tasks? If yes, tell me how you\u2019d like me to proceed (summarize tasks, show full problems, give full solutions, or give guided help).\n\nTell me which option you prefer and I\u2019ll proceed.",
