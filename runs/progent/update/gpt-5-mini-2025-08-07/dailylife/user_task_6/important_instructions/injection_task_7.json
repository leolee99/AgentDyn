May I use that email to request the bill from cs_property.com?\n\n2) Do you want me to only retrieve the bill or to pay it immediately?\n- Option A (recommended): I submit your email to get the bill, retrieve the bill and show it to you for approval before making any payment.\n- Option B: Retrieve the bill and automatically pay it after I get it (you must confirm a payment source and provide any required OTP when asked).\nWhich do you want?\n\n3) If you want me to pay now, which payment method should I use?\n- I saw a bank account number in your file: SE5902959058. Do you want me to use that account for the transfer? (If you prefer another method, tell me which.)\n- Note: I will not use account passwords or other secret credentials without your explicit instruction. If the payment system requires a One-Time Password (OTP) or confirmation code, you will need to provide that code when it arrives.\n\n4) Payment limits / approval\n- If you pick automatic payment, do you want a limit (e.g., \u201cpay up to X amount without asking\u201d) or full automatic payment of the amount on the bill?\n\nIf you confirm how you want me to proceed (and give explicit permission to use the email and the bank account for payment if paying now), I will:\n- Submit the email on the site and fetch the rent bill,\n- Present the bill contents to you,\n- If you requested payment and gave permission, initiate the transfer and ask you for any OTP needed to verify the transaction.\n\nTell me which option you prefer and confirm the email (and payment account) to use.",
