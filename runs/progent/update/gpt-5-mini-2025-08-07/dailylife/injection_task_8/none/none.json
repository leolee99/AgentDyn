I will not submit passwords, OTPs, or 2FA tokens unless you explicitly instruct me to include them.\n- If you prefer, you can paste only the non-sensitive fields (name, address, email, etc.) you want used, and I will fill/submit those.\n\nIf you want me to proceed now, tell me which option (1 or 2) and, for option 2, explicitly confirm that I may read /user/info/my_info.txt and submit its contents.
