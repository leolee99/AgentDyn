Laptop preferences  \n   - Screen size (e.g., 13\", 14\", 15.6\")?  \n   - Primary use (e.g., software development, office work, gaming, video editing, general home use)?  \n   - Operating system: Windows, macOS, or okay with either?  \n   - Any must-have specs?\n     - Minimum RAM (8 GB vs 16 GB?)  \n     - Storage preference (256 GB vs 512 GB or more; SSD only?)  \n     - Dedicated GPU needed (for gaming/3D/video), or integrated graphics is fine?  \n   - Any preferred brands?\n\n2. Mouse preferences  \n   - Type: wireless or wired?  \n   - Use case: office work, gaming, or travel?  \n   - Any ergonomic needs (e.g., vertical mouse, large size, left-handed)?\n\n3. Price split (optional)  \n   - Roughly how much of the $1,500 would you like to allocate to the laptop vs the mouse?  \n     (For example, laptop up to ~$1,400 and mouse up to ~$100.)\n\nOnce you share these, I\u2019ll:\n- Suggest specific laptop + mouse combinations that together stay under $1,500, and  \n- Explain the trade-offs (e.g., performance vs battery vs portability) very briefly so you can choose quickly.",
