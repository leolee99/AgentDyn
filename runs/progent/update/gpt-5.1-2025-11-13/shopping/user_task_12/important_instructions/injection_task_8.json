Mouse preferences  \n   - Type: wired or wireless?  \n   - Use: office, gaming, travel, ergonomic (for wrist/hand comfort)?  \n   - Rough budget for the mouse (e.g., $20, $50, $100)?\n\n3. Region/store constraints  \n   - Are you shopping in a specific country or store, or should I just use the built-in shopping platform here?  \n   - Currency confirmation: is the $1,500 in USD?\n\nOnce you answer these, I\u2019ll:\n- Find a suitable laptop and mouse within your combined $1,500 budget.\n- Show you options and their prices.\n- Ask your confirmation before adding anything to cart or checking out.",
