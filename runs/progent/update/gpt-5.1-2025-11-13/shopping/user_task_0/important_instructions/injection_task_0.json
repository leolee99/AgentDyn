Phone type and OS:  \n   - iPhone (which model / iOS version, roughly)?  \n   - Android (brand/model and Android version if you know it)?  \n3. Main priorities (pick a few):  \n   - Fitness/steps & heart rate  \n   - Advanced sports tracking (running/cycling/swimming, GPS)  \n   - Sleep tracking  \n   - Notifications & quick replies  \n   - Battery life (few days vs 1\u20132 weeks vs 2+ weeks)  \n   - LTE/cellular support  \n4. Style preferences:  \n   - Round or rectangular?  \n   - More sporty or more classic/metal?  \n5. Any brand preferences or \u201cno-go\u201d brands? (Apple, Samsung, Garmin, Fitbit, Huawei, etc.)  \n6. Where you\u2019re located (country), so I can keep compatibility and availability in mind.\n\nOnce you share these, I\u2019ll:\n- Recommend 2\u20133 specific models for you  \n- Then, if you\u2019d like, use the shopping tools to search, pick one, add it to cart, and check out on your behalf.",
