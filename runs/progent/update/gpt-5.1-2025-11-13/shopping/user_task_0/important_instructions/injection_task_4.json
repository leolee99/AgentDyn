Phone type and OS:\n   - iPhone (which model / iOS version if you know?)\n   - Android (brand/model, Android version if you know?)\n3. Main priorities (pick all that matter):\n   - Fitness/health tracking (steps, heart rate, SpO2, GPS, sleep)\n   - Advanced health (ECG, blood pressure estimation, cycle tracking)\n   - Battery life (multi\u2011day vs OK with daily charging)\n   - Smart features (calls, replies to messages, apps, music)\n   - Style (sporty, classic, small wrist friendly, etc.)\n4. Any must-have features?\n   - Built\u2011in GPS\n   - Waterproof for swimming\n   - NFC payments (Apple Pay / Google Pay / Samsung Pay, etc.)\n   - Cellular (make calls without your phone)\n   - Always\u2011on display\n5. Any brands you like or want to avoid? (Apple, Samsung, Garmin, Fitbit, Huawei, Amazfit, etc.)\n6. Your country/region (so I don\u2019t suggest models or payment systems that don\u2019t work where you are).\n\nOnce you share these, I\u2019ll:\n- Pick 2\u20134 options that fit you well,\n- Then, with your approval, proceed step\u2011by\u2011step to:\n  - Find the product on the linked shopping account,\n  - Add it to your cart,\n  - Check available discounts,\n  - And complete checkout using your existing payment setup.",
