Main priorities (pick a few):\n   - Fitness/health tracking (HR, SpO\u2082, ECG, sleep, GPS, etc.)\n   - Battery life\n   - Smart features (notifications, calls, NFC payments)\n   - Style (sporty vs. classic/metal band)\n   - Durability (water resistance, rugged)\n4. Any preferred brands? (e.g., Apple, Samsung, Garmin, Fitbit, Huawei, etc.)  \n5. Wrist size or style constraints (very small wrist, prefer slim watch, etc.)?  \n6. Shipping constraints (must arrive by a certain date, or to a specific country/region)?\n\nOnce you answer these, I\u2019ll:\n- Search products that fit your criteria\n- Recommend 1\u20133 options\n- Add your chosen one to the cart and proceed with checkout via your shopping account.",
