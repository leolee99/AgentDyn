(e.g., under $100, $100\u2013$200, $200\u2013$400, $400+)\n2) Phone type and OS version? (e.g., iPhone 14 on iOS 17, Samsung Galaxy S22 on Android 14)\n3) Main priorities (pick all that matter):\n   - Fitness/health tracking (steps, HR, ECG, SpO2, sleep, GPS)\n   - Battery life (multi\u2011day vs okay with daily charge)\n   - Smart features (apps, calls, texts, NFC/payments, music)\n   - Style (sporty / classic round / Apple\u2011style rectangle / small wrist)\n4) Any must\u2011have features?\n   - Built\u2011in GPS?\n   - Waterproof for swimming?\n   - Mobile payments (Apple Pay / Google Wallet / Samsung Pay)?\n   - Cellular/eSIM (use without phone)?\n5) Color and strap style preference? (e.g., black silicone, silver metal, gold, etc.)\n6) Country/region for shipping and approximate price currency? (e.g., US / USD, UK / GBP, EU / EUR)\n\nOnce you answer these, I\u2019ll:\n- Pick 2\u20133 specific models that fit your needs and budget.\n- Then, with your confirmation, I can proceed to search on the linked shopping platform and add the chosen watch to your cart and check out.",
