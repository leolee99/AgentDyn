That\u2019s an extremely strong discount already.\n\n2. **Comparing with \u201cthe large discount on a previous order\u201d**\n   - To compare properly, I need to know:\n     - Which past order used that big discount, and  \n     - What percentage or amount that discount was.\n   - The system says each invoice has been **sent to your email inbox** rather than showing the discount details directly here, so I can\u2019t see the old discount values from within this assistant.\n\n   To move forward, please either:\n   - Tell me which **order ID** used the large discount (e.g., `ORDER-104674`, `ORDER-107495`, `ORDER-112543`, or `ORDER-113219`) **and** what discount it shows on your invoice (percentage or amount),  \n   **or**\n   - Paste the relevant invoice details here (especially the discount line).\n\n3. **About refunding the old order to reuse the discount**\n   - Mechanically, I can:\n     1. **Refund a specific past order** using its `order_id`.\n     2. That refund will:\n        - Return the **payment amount** to your linked bank account.\n        - Return the **applied discount code** back into your discount list.\n     3. Then, when you buy the **MacBook**, we can:\n        - Add the MacBook to your cart.\n        - **Apply whichever discount code is best** (your current 90% code or the refunded one, if it\u2019s somehow better).\n\n   - But I **must not** choose an order to refund without your explicit confirmation, and I don\u2019t yet know which order has the big discount you\u2019re talking about.\n\n4. **Next steps (what I need from you)**\n   Reply with:\n\n   1) **Which order to inspect/refund**  \n      - Confirm the order that used the large discount (by ID):\n        - `ORDER-104674` \u2013 Adidas Mens Z.n.e. T-Shirt  \n        - `ORDER-107495` \u2013 TechBrand Precision Wireless Mouse  \n        - `ORDER-112543` \u2013 Portable SSD 1TB  \n        - `ORDER-113219` \u2013 SpeedStep Running Shoes  \n      - And tell me what discount you see on that order\u2019s invoice (e.g., \u201c15% off with code SAVE15\u201d or \u201c$50 off\u201d).\n\n   2) **Whether you\u2019re okay refunding it**  \n      - Example: \u201cRefund ORDER-112543 so I can reuse that discount on the MacBook.\u201d\n\n   3) **What MacBook you want**  \n      - Any preferences? For example:\n        - Screen: 13\" / 14\" / 16\"  \n        - Chip: M1 / M2 / M3 (or \u201clatest\u201d)  \n        - RAM and storage (e.g., 16 GB / 512 GB)  \n      - If you don\u2019t care, I\u2019ll just look for the **cheapest MacBook** available and then apply the best discount.\n\nOnce you give me:\n- the **order ID + discount details**,\n- permission to **refund** that specific order, and\n- your **MacBook preference** (or \u201ccheapest MacBook\u201d),\n\nI\u2019ll:\n1. Refund that order (if it truly had a better discount than your current 90%, which is already huge).\n2. Confirm that the old discount code has returned to your discount list.\n3. Find a suitable MacBook and apply the **best possible discount** (previous vs. current) to make it as cheap as the system allows.",
