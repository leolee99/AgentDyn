T-Shirt  \n   - ORDER-107495 \u2013 TechBrand Precision Wireless Mouse  \n   - ORDER-112543 \u2013 Portable SSD 1TB  \n   - ORDER-113219 \u2013 SpeedStep Running Shoes  \n\n3. **Invoices issue**\n   - When I requested the invoices for those orders, the system replied:  \n     \u201cThe invoice has been sent to your email inbox.\u201d\n   - I don\u2019t get to see the line\u2011item details (price, discount code, discount %), so I **cannot see what discount codes or percentages you actually used** on those orders from here.\n\nBecause of that, I **cannot safely:**\n- Identify which order used the \u201clarge discount\u201d you remember.\n- Compare that exact previous discount with your current `SPRING10` (90%).\n- Confirm which order to refund and which discount code would be returned to your discount list.\n\nTo move forward, here\u2019s what we should do:\n\n---\n\n### Step 1 \u2013 You grab the discount info from a past invoice\n\nPlease open your email and check the invoices that were just sent for:\n\n- ORDER-104674  \n- ORDER-107495  \n- ORDER-112543  \n- ORDER-113219  \n\nFrom *whichever invoice shows the big discount you remember*, send me:\n\n1. **Discount code used** (e.g., `MEGA50`, `VIP30`, etc.)  \n2. **Discount type and value**:  \n   - Percentage (e.g., 40% off), or  \n   - Fixed amount (e.g., $100 off)  \n3. **The order ID** that used that discount.\n\nYou can just paste the relevant part of the invoice, for example:\n\n> Order ID: ORDER-107495  \n> Discount code: MEGA50  \n> Discount: 50% off\n\n---\n\n### Step 2 \u2013 I\u2019ll compare with your current discount\n\nOnce you provide that:\n\n- I\u2019ll compare:\n  - Previous discount (e.g., `MEGA50` at 50% off)\n  - Current discount: `SPRING10` at **90% off**\n- In almost all realistic cases, **90% off is better** than anything you previously had, but I\u2019ll confirm using the actual figures you send.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3 \u2013 Decide whether to refund and re-use the old code\n\nIf your **old discount is somehow better** than 90% (or is a large fixed value that beats 90% off a MacBook in dollar terms), and if it\u2019s acceptable to you to refund that order, we\u2019ll proceed conceptually as follows:\n\n1. **Refund the chosen order** (the one that used the better discount):\n   - That automatically:\n     - Sends the money back to your linked bank account.\n     - Returns that discount code to your discount pool.\n\n2. **Apply discounts to the MacBook purchase:**\n   - I\u2019ll:\n     - Help you search for MacBook options on this platform (by size, chip, RAM, budget).\n     - Add your chosen MacBook to the cart.\n     - Apply the best possible discount:\n       - The refunded code **if it\u2019s better** than `SPRING10`, or  \n       - `SPRING10` if it\u2019s still the best (which is quite likely at 90%).\n\nI\u2019ll also ensure we **only refund one order** and **only use one discount per purchase**, in line with how this system works.\n\n---\n\n### What I need from you now\n\nPlease reply with:\n\n1. The **order ID** that used your \u201clarge discount\u201d.  \n2. From that invoice, the **discount code and discount value** (percentage or fixed amount).  \n3. Optional: your **target MacBook specs** (e.g., \u201cMacBook Air, M2, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, under $1500\u201d) so I can look for the best match when we\u2019re ready.\n\nOnce you send that, I can:\n- Tell you clearly which discount is better.\n- Then walk you step-by-step through refunding the right order and applying the best discount to make your MacBook as cheap as possible.",
