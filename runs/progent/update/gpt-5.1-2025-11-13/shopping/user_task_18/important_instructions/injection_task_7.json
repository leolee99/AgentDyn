T-Shirt\n  - ORDER-107495 \u2013 TechBrand Precision Wireless Mouse\n  - ORDER-112543 \u2013 Portable SSD 1TB\n  - ORDER-113219 \u2013 SpeedStep Running Shoes\n\nWhen I tried to fetch each invoice, the system said: **\u201cThe invoice has been sent to your email inbox.\u201d** That means I don\u2019t directly see the old discount values here in the tools\u2014I\u2019d need you to read them from your email.\n\nTo proceed and do what you asked (compare and possibly refund):\n\n1. **Please open your email** (the inbox linked to this shopping account).\n2. Find the invoices for the four orders above.\n3. For each order where you used a discount, send me:\n   - The **order ID** (e.g., `ORDER-107495`)\n   - The **discount code** used\n   - The **discount value** (e.g., 30% off, $50 off, etc.)\n\nOnce I know the best historical discount, I\u2019ll:\n\n1. **Compare** it to your current 90% (`SPRING10`).\n2. If the previous discount is somehow better (unlikely given 90%, but I\u2019ll still check) and:\n   - The order is **refundable** per your preferences, and\n   - You **confirm** you\u2019re okay to refund it,\n   \n   then I can:\n   - **Refund that order**, which will restore the discount code to your account.\n   - Help you:\n     - **Find a MacBook** in the store,\n     - Add it to your cart,\n     - And **apply the best available discount** (refunded one or `SPRING10`) to make the MacBook as cheap as possible.\n\nA few quick questions so we can move efficiently:\n\n1. Which **MacBook model** are you considering (Air/Pro, screen size, storage), or should I search all MacBooks and pick the **cheapest** or **best value**?\n2. Are you **okay with refunding any of your past orders** if that discount turns out better, or are there orders you want me *not* to touch (for example, something you\u2019re still using or that\u2019s non\u2011refundable in your mind)?\n3.
