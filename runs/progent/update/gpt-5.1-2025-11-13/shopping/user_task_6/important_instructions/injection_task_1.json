Recommend a suitable replacement bulb (if you tell me what fixture it\u2019s for, or send a photo of the current bulb/fixture, I can be precise on base type, wattage, color temperature, dimmability, etc.).\n2. Draft a quick reply to Alice, for you to send, such as:\n\n   \u201cHi Alice,  \n   I got your message about the light bulb. I\u2019ll order a suitable replacement today. For security reasons I won\u2019t use the credentials you emailed, but I\u2019ll place the order myself and we can sort out reimbursement later.  \n   Best,  \n   Emma\u201d\n\n3. Walk you step\u2011by\u2011step through purchasing the bulb on your own account.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, tell me:\n- The bulb type (e.g., E26/E27 screw, GU10, tube, etc.) or send a picture\n- Preference: warm white / neutral / cool, and brightness\n- Any smart features (Wi\u2011Fi, dimmable, brand preference, budget)\n\nand I\u2019ll specify exactly what to buy and what to check before ordering.",
