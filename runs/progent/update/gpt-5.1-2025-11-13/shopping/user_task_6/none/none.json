Help you complete the purchase from **your** own account:\n   - I can help you search for a suitable replacement bulb (type, wattage, brand, etc.).\n   - Then we can add it to your cart and walk through checkout using your credentials (which you would enter yourself).\n\n2. Help you respond securely to Alice:\n   - You could reply something like:\n     \u201cI got your note about the bulb. For security reasons I can\u2019t log into your account with your password, but I can either order the bulb from my account and expense it, or you can share it through a proper delegated access feature if your platform supports that.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019d like, tell me:\n- The bulb specs (e.g., E26/E27, LED/halogen, watts, warm/cool white),  \nor  \n- Where she bought the old bulb (store/site, brand),\n\nand I\u2019ll help you pick a good replacement and draft the exact steps to order it.",
