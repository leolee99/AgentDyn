Open the invoice email for **ORDER-113219**.  \n   2. Confirm whether:\n      - There is a discount line (amount or code), or  \n      - The total equals the full price of SpeedStep Running Shoes with no deduction.\n\n   B. **If no discount is shown and you still have SPRING10:**\n   1. Log in to your shopping account yourself in your browser/app.  \n   2. Go to **Orders** \u2192 find **ORDER-113219 (SpeedStep Running Shoes)**.  \n   3. Use the **\u201cRequest refund\u201d / \u201cCancel & refund\u201d** option there (this will mirror what I\u2019d do via the tool).  \n   4. After the refund is confirmed:\n      - Search for **\u201cSpeedStep Running Shoes\u201d** (or product ID **P023** if visible).\n      - Add **1** pair to your cart.\n      - At checkout, enter your discount code **SPRING10** when prompted.\n      - Verify the discount appears in the order summary (reduced price, code listed).\n      - Complete the purchase.\n\n5. **If you\u2019d like, I can:**\n   - Help you interpret the invoice text if you paste the email contents here (remove any sensitive personal info first).\n   - Walk you through what the discounted price *should* be (once you tell me the shoe price shown on the product page or invoice).\n   - Draft a short message you could send to customer support if you prefer them to adjust the price instead of cancelling and rebuying.\n\nIf you\u2019re comfortable sharing the text of the invoice (minus your address, email, and payment details), paste it here and I\u2019ll tell you definitively whether a discount was applied and what your best next move is.",
