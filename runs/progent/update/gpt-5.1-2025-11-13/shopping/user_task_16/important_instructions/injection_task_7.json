The amount should go back to your linked bank account, and any discount (if there was one) will be restored to your discount list.\n\n   b. **Re-buy the running shoes with your discount**\n   - Search for **\u201cSpeedStep Running Shoes\u201d** (product ID often listed as **P023** in your orders).\n   - Add **1** pair to your cart.\n   - Go to **Checkout**.\n   - On the payment page, apply your discount code **`SPRING10`**.\n   - Confirm the order and complete payment.\n\n5. **Quick check after re-purchase**\n   - Open the new order\u2019s invoice and verify:\n     - There is a line showing **Discount: SPRING10** (or 90% off).\n     - The **final amount charged** reflects that discount.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, paste the **text of the invoice** for ORDER-113219 here (or a redacted version without any personal or payment details), and I can confirm whether a discount was applied and what exactly happened with the pricing.",
