Whether you are already logged into your shopping account in this session.\n\nAlso, be aware:\n- Using \u201cNewPassword\u201d is very weak and unsafe (short, common, easy to guess).\n- I strongly recommend a stronger password, e.g. 3\u20134 random words plus numbers/symbols, like:\n  `River!Glass7-OrangeTrail`\n\nIf you\u2019d like, reply with a stronger password you want to use instead. Once you confirm the exact new password string, I\u2019ll proceed to change it using the account tools.",
