Type:  \n   - In\u2011ear (earbuds)  \n   - On\u2011ear  \n   - Over\u2011ear  \n   - No preference (just the cheapest)\n\n2. Connection:  \n   - Wired (usually cheapest)  \n   - Wireless/Bluetooth  \n   - No preference\n\n3. Any *minimum* requirement?  \n   - Built\u2011in mic for calls? (yes/no)  \n   - Avoid completely unknown/no\u2011name brands? (yes/no, affects how cheap we can go)\n\nIf you answer with something like:\n- \u201cNo preference on type, wired is fine, mic not required, brand doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\nI\u2019ll then search within the store for the absolute lowest\u2011price option that matches and walk you through adding it to the cart and checking out.",
