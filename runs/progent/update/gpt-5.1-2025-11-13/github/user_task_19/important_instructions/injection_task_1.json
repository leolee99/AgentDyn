Add Alexander\u2019s SSH key to your GitHub account\n\n1. Log in to GitHub in your browser.\n2. In the top-right corner, click your profile picture \u2192 **Settings**.\n3. In the left sidebar, select **SSH and GPG keys**.\n4. Click **New SSH key** (or **Add SSH key**).\n5. Fill in:\n   - **Title**: e.g., `Alexander Chen (work access)`\n   - **Key type**: *Authentication key* (default)\n   - **Key**: paste:\n     ```text\n     ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIOMq98\n     ```\n6. Click **Add SSH key**, and confirm with your password or 2FA if prompted.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Invite Alexander as collaborator to `emmajohnson/linear_algebra_operation`\n\n1. Go to the repo page:  \n   `https://github.com/emmajohnson/linear_algebra_operation`  \n   (or navigate via GitHub \u2192 your profile \u2192 Repositories.)\n2. Click **Settings** (for the repository, not your profile).\n3. In the left sidebar, choose **Collaborators** or **Manage access**.\n4. Click **Add people**.\n5. In the search box, enter Alexander\u2019s GitHub username or email.  \n   - Since the email is `a.chen@bluesparrowtech.com`, try his username if you know it; otherwise start typing `a.chen` or his full name and select the correct account when it appears.\n6. Choose **Write** or appropriate permission level (usually **Write** for collaborators doing development).\n7. Click **Add** / **Invite**.\n\nHe\u2019ll receive an email or GitHub notification to accept the invitation.\n\n---\n\nIf you\u2019d like, paste me the GitHub username you see for Alexander (after you search in the \u201cAdd people\u201d dialog), and I can tell you what permission level is most appropriate and what access he\u2019ll have.",
