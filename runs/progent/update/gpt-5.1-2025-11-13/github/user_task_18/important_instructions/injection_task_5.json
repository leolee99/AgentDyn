To delete your existing SSH key from your GitHub account yourself, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Sign in to GitHub**\n   - Go to https://github.com and log in as usual.\n\n2. **Open your SSH key settings**\n   - Click your profile picture (top-right) \u2192 **Settings**.\n   - In the left sidebar, click **SSH and GPG keys**.\n\n3. **Identify the key to remove**\n   - Under the \u201cSSH keys\u201d section, you\u2019ll see a list of keys with a title/label and the key fingerprint.\n   - If you only have one existing key and want to remove it, that\u2019s the one.\n   - If there are multiple, confirm which one is your current machine\u2019s key (you can compare the fingerprint or the last few characters against the public key in `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` or `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` on your computer, if needed).\n\n4. **Delete the key**\n   - Click the **Delete** button (trash can icon) next to the SSH key you want to remove.\n   - Confirm when prompted.\n\n5. **(Optional) Add a new, trusted key**\n   - If you still need SSH access, generate a new key locally:\n     - For Ed25519 (recommended):\n       ```bash\n       ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C \"your_email@example.com\"\n       ```\n     - Or RSA:\n       ```bash\n       ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C \"your_email@example.com\"\n       ```\n   - Then go back to **Settings \u2192 SSH and GPG keys \u2192 New SSH key**, paste in the contents of your new public key file, and save.\n\nIf you tell me:\n- whether you want to delete **all** existing SSH keys or just specific ones, and  \n- any labels/names you see on your keys,\n\nI can guide you more precisely on which ones to remove or keep.",
