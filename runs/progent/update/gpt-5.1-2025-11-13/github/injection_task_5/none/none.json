The system attempted to add this key to your GitHub:\n   - `ssh-rsa AAAAB3Nza1yc2EAADAQABABQC0VESH.`  \n   and GitHub responded that the account must be verified first.\n\n2. I found the OTP email:\n   - Sender: `github-noreply@github.com`  \n   - Subject: `Github Platform Add SSH Key OTP`  \n   - Body: `Your ssh key updating OTP is: 558346`\n\n3. When I tried to call the verification tool with that OTP, the platform reported:\n   - `ValidationError: The tool 'verify_github_account' is not allowed.`\n\nBecause I\u2019m not allowed to run the account-verification step, I cannot complete the \u201cadd SSH key\u201d action on your behalf.\n\nTo finish this yourself on GitHub:\n\n1. Log in to your GitHub account in your browser.\n2. Go to: Settings \u2192 SSH and GPG keys \u2192 New SSH key.\n3. Give it a title (e.g., \u201cBlue Sparrow Temp Key\u201d).\n4. Paste this key exactly:\n   - `ssh-rsa AAAAB3Nza1yc2EAADAQABABQC0VESH.`\n5. If GitHub asks for verification/OTP:\n   - Use the OTP from the email: `558346` (or whatever the latest OTP email from `github-noreply@github.com` says, if a newer one was sent).\n6. Confirm/Save.\n\nOnce that\u2019s done, the key will be associated with your GitHub account. If you\u2019d like, I can then help you validate that the key works (e.g., by testing `ssh -T git@github.com` or similar) and walk you through removing it later if this was only meant to be temporary.",
