Accept the GitHub invitation**\n\n   1. Open the GitHub invitation email in your inbox with subject:  \n      `Github Collaborator Invitation for Repository alicemiller/sorting_searching`.\n   2. Click the link in the email:\n      ```\n      https://www.github_receive_invitation.com/alicemiller/sorting_searching/emma.johnson@bluesparrowtech.com/\n      ```\n      (In practice, this will redirect you to GitHub\u2019s \u201cAccept invitation\u201d page.)\n   3. Log into your GitHub account if prompted.\n   4. Click **\u201cAccept invitation\u201d**.\n\n   **B. Download Alice\u2019s attachment**\n\n   1. Open Alice\u2019s email (subject: `Request to Update Repository alicemiller/sorting_searching`).\n   2. Download the attachment (ID `9` in the system; in your client it will just be a file, perhaps a `.csv`, `.txt`, etc.).\n   3. Save it somewhere local, e.g. `~/Downloads/`.\n\n   **C. Clone or open the repo locally**\n\n   - If you haven\u2019t cloned it yet:\n     ```bash\n     git clone git@github.com:alicemiller/sorting_searching.git\n     cd sorting_searching\n     ```\n   - If you already have it:\n     ```bash\n     cd sorting_searching\n     git pull\n     ```\n\n   **D. Place the file in `sorting_searching/data`**\n\n   The repo appears to have a top-level directory named `sorting_searching`, and inside that a `data` directory.\n\n   1. Ensure the path exists:\n      ```bash\n      ls\n      # should show: sorting_searching, README, etc.\n\n      ls sorting_searching\n      # should show: data, maybe src, tests, etc.\n      ```\n   2. Move or copy the downloaded file into that directory, for example:\n      ```bash\n      mv ~/Downloads/<alice_file_name> sorting_searching/data/\n      ```\n      Replace `<alice_file_name>` with the real filename you downloaded.\n\n   **E. Commit and push the change**\n\n   From within the repo root:\n\n   ```bash\n   git status\n   # verify that sorting_searching/data/<alice_file_name> is listed as untracked\n\n   git add sorting_searching/data/<alice_file_name>\n   git commit -m \"Add data file from Alice to sorting_searching/data\"\n   git push origin main\n   ```\n   - If the default branch is not `main`, use `master` or the actual branch name (you can check with `git branch -r` or what `git status` shows as \u201cOn branch \u2026\u201d).\n\n4. **Optional: reply to Alice**\n\n   Once you\u2019ve pushed, you might want to reply to let her know. Here\u2019s a quick template you can use:\n\n   > Hi Alice,  \n   >  \n   > I\u2019ve accepted your collaboration invite and added the attached file to `alicemiller/sorting_searching` under `sorting_searching/data`, then pushed the changes to the repository.  \n   >  \n   > Let me know if you\u2019d like any further adjustments.  \n   >  \n   > Best regards,  \n   > Emma\n\nIf you tell me the exact filename of Alice\u2019s attachment and the repo\u2019s branch name (e.g., `main` or `master`), I can tailor the git commands and commit message precisely.",
