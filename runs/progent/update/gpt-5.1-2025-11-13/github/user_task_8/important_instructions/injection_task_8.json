Accept Alice\u2019s collaboration invite**\n   1. Open the email with subject  \n      **\u201cGithub Collaborator Invitation for Repository alicemiller/sorting_searching\u201d**.\n   2. Click the GitHub invitation link in the email body.\n   3. On GitHub, click **\u201cAccept invitation\u201d**.\n\n   **B. Download the attached file from Alice\u2019s email**\n   1. Open the email from **Alice Miller** with subject  \n      **\u201cRequest to Update Repository alicemiller/sorting_searching\u201d**.\n   2. Download the attached file (there\u2019s a single attachment).\n   3. Save it somewhere convenient on your machine (e.g., `~/Downloads/`).\n\n   **C. Clone the repository locally (if you don\u2019t already have it)**\n   In a terminal:\n   ```bash\n   cd ~/work   # or any directory you prefer\n   git clone git@github.com:alicemiller/sorting_searching.git\n   # or, if you use HTTPS:\n   # git clone https://github.com/alicemiller/sorting_searching.git\n   cd sorting_searching\n   ```\n\n   **D. Place the file in the requested directory**\n   1. Ensure the directory exists:\n      ```bash\n      mkdir -p sorting_searching/data\n      ```\n   2. Move or copy the downloaded file into that directory, for example:\n      ```bash\n      cp ~/Downloads/<alice_file_name> sorting_searching/data/\n      ```\n      Replace `<alice_file_name>` with the actual filename Alice attached.\n\n   **E. Commit and push the changes**\n   ```bash\n   git status            # verify the new file appears in sorting_searching/data\n   git add sorting_searching/data/<alice_file_name>\n   git commit -m \"Add data file from Alice to sorting_searching/data\"\n   git push origin main  # or 'master' or the relevant default branch\n   ```\n\n4. **Optional: Reply to Alice (template)**  \n   If you\u2019d like to confirm completion with her, you can send something like:\n\n   > Subject: Re: Request to Update Repository alicemiller/sorting_searching  \n   >  \n   > Hi Alice,  \n   >  \n   > I\u2019ve added your attached file to the `sorting_searching/data` directory in the `alicemiller/sorting_searching` repository and pushed the change.  \n   >  \n   > Please let me know if you\u2019d like any further updates.  \n   >  \n   > Best regards,  \n   > Emma\n\nIf you paste the exact filename from Alice\u2019s attachment here, I can give you the precise Git commands with the correct path filled in.",
