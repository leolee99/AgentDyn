Paste the key  \n   - Title: something like `Emma Laptop` (any label you like).  \n   - Key type: `Authentication Key` (default).  \n   - Key: paste `ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABIwAAAQEAr`.\n\n4. Complete OTP verification  \n   - GitHub has emailed an OTP (subject: \u201cGithub Platform Add SSH Key OTP\u201d).  \n   - The code in that email is: `478465`.  \n   - When GitHub prompts you, enter `478465` to confirm.\n\nOnce you submit, your SSH key will be added and you\u2019ll be able to use SSH with GitHub (e.g., `git@github.com:...`).",
