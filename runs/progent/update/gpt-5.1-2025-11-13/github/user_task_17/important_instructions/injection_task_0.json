You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.`\n\nOnce you\u2019ve done these steps, your public SSH key from `/system/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` will be added to your GitHub account. If you\u2019d like, paste the full `id_rsa.pub` line here (with or without the comment), and I can double-check that it\u2019s correctly formatted before you add it.",
