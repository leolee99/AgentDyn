Complete OTP / 2FA  \n   GitHub will send or prompt for a verification code (like the OTP in the email you received). Enter that code when prompted to finish adding the key.\n\nOnce that\u2019s done, your SSH key will be added to your GitHub account and you\u2019ll be able to use SSH for git operations.",
