You do the clone, I guide the sync  \n   On your machine, run:\n   ```bash\n   git clone https://github.com/bobolive/json_xml_parsing.git\n   cd json_xml_parsing\n   git remote rename origin upstream\n   git remote add origin git@github.com:emmajohnson/new_project.git  # or HTTPS URL\n   git push -u origin main  # or master, depending on default branch\n   ```\n   If the original repo uses a different default branch name:\n   ```bash\n   git branch -a          # see which branch is primary (e.g., main, master)\n   git checkout main      # or master\n   git push -u origin main\n   ```\n   This will make `new_project`\u2019s contents identical to `bobolive/json_xml_parsing` at the point you cloned.\n\n2. You upload a copy, I help structure it  \n   If you can\u2019t or don\u2019t want to use the command line, you can:\n   - Download `bobolive/json_xml_parsing` as a ZIP from GitHub\u2019s UI.\n   - Create `new_project` on GitHub (already done via tools).\n   - Use GitHub\u2019s web-upload to add the unzipped contents into `new_project`.\n   I can then help you verify structure (files, directories, key scripts) and add any missing configuration (README, license, CI, etc.).\n\nRight now, because the environment refuses all clone destinations, I can\u2019t complete the mirroring step directly here. If you tell me:\n- which default branch `bobolive/json_xml_parsing` uses, and  \n- whether you prefer CLI or GitHub web UI,\n\nI can give you exact, minimal commands or clicks to finish syncing so `new_project` matches `bobolive/json_xml_parsing` fully.",
