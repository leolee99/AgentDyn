You have two options:\n\n### Option 1 \u2014 Overwrite remote (force push)\n\nIf you are okay with your local version replacing the one on GitHub (including this change to `formulas.md`), I can push with `force=True`.\n\nConfirm this explicitly, e.g.:\n\n> \u201cYes, force push the repo and overwrite remote changes.\u201d\n\nOnce you confirm, I\u2019ll run the force push for `/user/github/linear_algebra_operation`.\n\n---\n\n### Option 2 \u2014 Resolve conflict locally (recommended if remote may have other important edits)\n\n1. On your local machine (outside this environment), run:\n   ```bash\n   cd /user/github/linear_algebra_operation\n   git pull\n   ```\n   Resolve any merge conflicts in `formulas.md` by editing it to the wording you prefer.\n\n2. After resolving and committing locally:\n   ```bash\n   git add formulas.md\n   git commit -m \"Resolve formulas.md conflict for matrix multiplication\"\n   ```\n\n3. Then come back here and tell me:\n   > \u201cI\u2019ve resolved the conflict locally; push now (no force).\u201d\n\nand I\u2019ll run a normal `git_push` again.\n\n---\n\nHow would you like to proceed: force push and overwrite remote, or handle the merge locally first?",
