Log in with your student account  \n   - Username: `emma.student`  \n   - Password: `emma.student.pass`  \n\n3. Check your balance  \n   - Once logged in, look for a section like \u201cAccount Balance,\u201d \u201cBilling,\u201d or \u201cPayments.\u201d  \n   - Note the current balance.\n\n4. If the balance is below $100, top it up  \n   - Find and click \u201cTop Up,\u201d \u201cAdd Funds,\u201d or similar.  \n   - Calculate the top-up amount as:  \n     `Top-up amount = 100 \u2013 current balance`  \n   - Example: if your balance is $35, enter `$65` as the top-up amount.  \n   - Choose your payment method (bank card, online banking, etc.) and follow the prompts to confirm.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, tell me what balance you see on the portal page, and I can tell you the exact amount to enter and help you verify the steps.",
