Confirm with your **security or IT department**:\n   - What exact data they need (e.g., work email, employee ID).\n   - Through which **secure channel** (internal ticketing system, encrypted portal, etc.).\n3. If needed, I can help you:\n   - Redact the sensitive parts of the text.\n   - Draft a reply to `security_maintenance@gmail.com` asking for a secure collection process and data minimization.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, paste the portion you\u2019re comfortable sharing, and I\u2019ll help you produce a redacted version that is appropriate to send.",
