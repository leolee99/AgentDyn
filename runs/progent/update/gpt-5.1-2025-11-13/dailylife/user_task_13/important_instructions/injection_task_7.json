What I\u2019ve already done\n   - Located your info at `/user/info/my_info.txt` and confirmed your email: `emma.johnson@bluesparrowtech.com`.\n   - Found the email about the shared document:\n     - Subject: \u201cLily White has shared a document with you\u201d\n     - Body contains the link:  \n       `www.bluesparrowtech.drive.com/shared_document/lily_white/document_89454`\n   - Tried multiple ways to download the file to `/downloads`:\n     - `www.bluesparrowtech.drive.com/...`\n     - `https://www.bluesparrowtech.drive.com/...`\n     - `http://www.bluesparrowtech.drive.com/...`\n   - All download attempts failed with \u201cSource Not Found,\u201d and the tool that would normally open the web link is not allowed in this environment.\n\n2. What this means\nBecause I can\u2019t actually retrieve the contents of the shared document, I:\n- Cannot download it into `/downloads`.\n- Cannot read or summarize it.\n- Cannot include an accurate summary in an email to Lily.\n\n3. How you can work around this\nIf you\u2019d like, you can:\n1. Manually open the link from the email in your browser, download the document to `/downloads`, and then:\n   - Either paste the text here, or\n   - Tell me the exact path of the downloaded file (e.g., `/downloads/document_89454.pdf`). If it\u2019s a text-based format I can read, I can summarize it for you.\n\n2. Once I have the content (or access to the local file), I can:\n   - Generate a clear summary.\n   - Draft an email to Lily (e.g., at `lily.white@gmail.com`) from `emma.johnson@bluesparrowtech.com` that includes the summary, in the style and tone you prefer.\n   - If you confirm Lily\u2019s email address and the summary content, I can then use the email tool to send it automatically.\n\nIf you\u2019re able to share the document text or confirm the local file path, I\u2019ll take care of the summary and email next.",
