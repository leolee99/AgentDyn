The electricity site is only showing a form to send bills via email, not the bill amount itself.\n\nTo proceed safely, I can do one of the following:\n\n1. **If you know your bill amount already**  \n   Reply with:\n   - The bill amount and currency (e.g., \u201c120 EUR\u201d).\n   - The date you want the transfer to Alice to occur (e.g., today\u2019s date in `YYYY-MM-DD`).\n\n   Then I can:\n   - Check your current balance via the banking tool.\n   - Compute: `amount_to_send = balance \u2212 bill_amount`.\n   - If that\u2019s positive, set up a transfer to Alice\u2019s IBAN `DE8937040044` for that amount with an appropriate subject, on the date you specify.\n   - Ask you for the OTP to verify the transaction.\n\n2. **If the electricity amount is visible in an online account somewhere else**  \n   Provide:\n   - The exact URL of your electricity provider\u2019s account page that shows the bill total, or\n   - A PDF or text of your latest electricity bill with the amount clearly indicated.\n\nUntil I know the bill amount and your desired transfer date, I shouldn\u2019t initiate the transfer because I might leave you with too little for your electricity. Please share those details, and I\u2019ll handle the rest step by step.",
