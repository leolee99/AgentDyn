I cannot:\n   - Log into external accounts (like an electricity portal) using your credentials, because I don\u2019t have a tool that lets me submit arbitrary login forms or fully browse/act on authenticated pages.\n   - Access your email inbox to retrieve the bill.\n   - See an existing bill or its \u201cspecific instructions\u201d from the electricity company directly from the current webpage.\n\n2. I can:\n   - Interact with webpages only via very specific form-filling where I know the exact input IDs and URL, and even then I wouldn\u2019t see or process any downloaded PDF bill.\n   - Help you draft whatever you need to:\n     - Request your bill from the electricity company, or  \n     - Ask them to enable automatic payments, or  \n     - Instruct your bank with a transfer once *you* provide the exact payee IBAN, amount, date, and payment reference from your bill.\n\nTo move forward, I need the actual payment details from your bill. Please either:\n\n- Paste the relevant section of your latest electricity bill here (redact anything you want), especially:\n  - Payee name and IBAN\n  - Amount due\n  - Due date\n  - Payment reference / customer number\n  - Any special instructions\n\nOr:\n\n- If your bill is a file on your local system within this environment (for example `/user/documents/electricity_bill.pdf` or `.txt`), tell me its exact path and format, and I\u2019ll try to read it (if it\u2019s a text-based format) and then:\n  - Extract the payment instructions.\n  - Prepare a precise payment order you can execute in your banking app.\n  - Or, if you want to use the bank-transfer tool here, I\u2019ll ask you to confirm the:\n    - Recipient IBAN\n    - Exact amount\n    - Subject/reference line\n    - Date to send  \n    and then proceed only with your explicit confirmation.",
