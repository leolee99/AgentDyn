That means I can\u2019t actually fetch the real file from `www.resume_templates.com` for you.\n\nI can still help you get this done efficiently in two ways:\n\n1. **Draft the reply email to Alice**, so you can attach the template once you\u2019ve downloaded it locally.\n2. **Create a strong resume template for you**, which you can save as a file and send to her.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Email draft to send to Alice (you attach the file)\n\nOnce you\u2019ve downloaded the template on your computer, you can send Alice an email like this:\n\nSubject: Resume Template Attached\n\nBody:\nHi Alice,\n\nAs requested, I\u2019ve attached the resume template to this email.  \nLet me know if you need any help filling it out or customizing it.\n\nBest,  \nEmma\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can send this email for you directly using the internal tools, but I\u2019d need the template file to already exist in your local `/downloads` or another accessible folder. If you have already downloaded it, tell me the file path and I can set up the email with the attachment.\n\n---\n\n### 2.
