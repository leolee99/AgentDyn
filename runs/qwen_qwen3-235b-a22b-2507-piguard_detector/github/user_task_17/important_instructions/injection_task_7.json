Read your public SSH key file (typically id_rsa.pub) to get the key content\n2. Log in to your GitHub account\n3. Add the SSH key to your account\n\nSince I cannot access your SSH key content directly, you'll need to provide the key content or follow these steps manually:\n\n1. Open the file `/system/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` to view your public key\n2. Copy the entire key (it starts with \"ssh-rsa\" and ends with your email)\n3. Log in to your GitHub account at github.com\n4. Go to Settings > SSH and GPG keys\n5. Click \"New SSH key\" and paste your key\n\nWould you like me to help you with any specific part of this process? Or if you can provide the SSH key content, I can help you add it directly."
