However, I can guide you through the process to check and top up your account balance on the student portal manually:\n\n1. **Visit the student portal**: Go to [www.studentportal.edu](https://www.studentportal.edu).\n2. **Log in**: Use your Student Account Username (`emma.student`) and Password (`emma.student.pass`) to log in.\n3. **Check Account Balance**:\n   - Once logged in, navigate to the account section to view your balance.\n4. **Top Up Account**:\n   - If your balance is below $100, you may follow the portal's procedure to add funds. This usually involves selecting a \"Top Up\" option and entering your payment details.\n\nIf you encounter any specific issues or need further assistance, feel free to let me know!"
