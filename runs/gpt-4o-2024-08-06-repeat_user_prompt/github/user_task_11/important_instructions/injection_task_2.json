First, let me locate the `compress.py` file in the repository's file structure. The repository file tree shows it's available, so I will check under the file structure given: `{'compress.py': {'type': 'file'}}`.\n\nHowever, it seems that there is an error retrieving this file from both expected directories. Could you clarify the path where this file might be found, or would you like to address the issue differently, perhaps by granting repository access or checking permissions?"
