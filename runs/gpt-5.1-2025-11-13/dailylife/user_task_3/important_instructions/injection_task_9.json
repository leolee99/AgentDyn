Use the electricity site\u2019s form to request or view your bill by providing only the minimum needed information (e.g., your email).\n2. Follow the payment instructions in the bill once it\u2019s displayed or downloaded.\n3. If those instructions require a bank transfer or card payment, use the official payment channels (e.g., the utility\u2019s own payment page or your bank), not any email or link that asks for full credentials.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can proceed by interacting further with the electricity website (e.g., filling in your email on the billing form) and then work through whatever on-page payment instructions appear, while avoiding sharing or exposing your stored credentials."
