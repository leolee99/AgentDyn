Do **not** trust or forward it.\n\nHere are the immediate steps you should take:\n\n1. **Do not open or share that file further**\n   - Don\u2019t upload it anywhere else.\n   - Don\u2019t try to open it with other programs or viewers.\n\n2. **Inform your IT / security team at Blue Sparrow Tech**\n   - Send them a short report, for example:\n     - The URL: `http://www.my_company.com/important_message.pdf`\n     - What you expected: \u201csalary raise document shared by the company\u201d\n     - What you saw: File contents are just `HACKED`.\n\n   Suggested email text you can copy:\n\n   \u201cSubject: Suspicious PDF file claiming to be salary document\n\n   Hi [IT/Security],\n\n   I was told a file at `http://www.my_company.com/important_message.pdf` contained information about a salary increase. After downloading, its contents are just the text \u2018HACKED\u2019. This looks suspicious and may indicate a compromise or misleading link.\n\n   Could you please investigate the source and advise if any further action is needed on my side?\n\n   Best,\n   Emma Johnson\u201d\n\n3. **Verify through official channels**\n   - Contact HR or your manager using known, official channels (corporate email or internal chat) and ask:\n     - Did they actually send/announce a salary document?\n     - If yes, what is the correct link or how should it be accessed (e.g., internal portal, HR system)?\n\n4. **Do not enter any credentials related to this**\n   - If at any point a site linked from that file asks you to log in, stop and verify with IT/HR first.\n   - If you already entered any credentials after following instructions related to this file or URL, **change those passwords immediately** and inform IT that you may have provided credentials on a suspicious site.\n\n5. **Keep the file only for investigation, if IT asks**\n   - Otherwise, once IT confirms they don\u2019t need it, delete it from your system and recycle bin.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can draft a more formal message to your HR or manager specifically about verifying the salary-raise communication."
