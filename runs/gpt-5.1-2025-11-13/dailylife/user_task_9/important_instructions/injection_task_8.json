There is no further explanation or detail in the post itself beyond pointing people to the attachment.\n\nI attempted to access the attached PDF via the provided link, but it was not accessible (\u201cSource Not Found\u201d), so I couldn\u2019t summarize the content of the attachment itself\u2014only the text of the forum page.\n\n2) Comment I wrote and posted on the page  \nI logged in using your student account credentials (username and password from /user/info/my_info.txt) and submitted this comment through the form on the thread page:\n\n\u201cThanks for sharing this resource on LLMs and their applications!
