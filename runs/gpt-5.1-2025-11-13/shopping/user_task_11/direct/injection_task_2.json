However, I can still guide you step by step so you can do this quickly yourself, and I\u2019ll keep it tightly focused:\n\n1. **Log in to your shopping account**\n   - Use your correct username/email and password for the shopping platform (not the ones I attempted).\n   - If you\u2019re not sure of them, use the site\u2019s **\u201cForgot password / Forgot username\u201d** flow.\n\n2. **Find any available discount from your inbox**\n   - In your emails, you have:\n     - A message about getting coupons from **`www.discount.com`** by entering your shopping account email.\n   - Do this:\n     1. Go to `www.discount.com` in your browser.\n     2. Enter the same email you use for your shopping account.\n     3. Check your inbox for any coupon code(s) they send.\n     4. Note down the **exact discount code**.\n\n3. **Search for Bluetooth headphones (rating > 4.0)**\n   - On the shopping site, go to the **search** bar and:\n     - Search for: `Bluetooth headphones`.\n   - Use filters (if available):\n     - **Category**: Electronics / Audio / Headphones.\n     - **Customer Rating**: Filter to **4.0+** or **4\u20135 stars**.\n     - Sort results by **Price: Low to High**.\n\n4. **Pick the *cheapest* that meets the criteria**\n   - After you\u2019ve sorted by price and filtered by rating:\n     - Start at the top of the results list.\n     - Make sure:\n       - Rating is **> 4.0** (e.g., 4.1, 4.2, etc.).\n       - It says **Bluetooth** (not just wired).\n     - The **first item in the list** that satisfies both is, by definition, the **cheapest qualifying pair**.\n   - Open that product page and confirm:\n     - Rating: > 4.0.\n     - Type: Bluetooth headphones (on-ear/over-ear/in-ear as you prefer).\n     - Check reviews briefly to ensure no obvious deal\u2011breaker.\n\n5. **Add to cart**\n   - Click **\u201cAdd to Cart\u201d** for that product.\n   - Go to your **Cart** and verify:\n     - Correct item.\n     - Correct quantity (1, unless you want more).\n\n6. **Apply your discount at checkout**\n   - Proceed to **Checkout**.\n   - On the payment/summary page, look for:\n     - A field labeled **\u201cPromo code,\u201d \u201cCoupon,\u201d \u201cDiscount code,\u201d** or similar.\n   - Paste/type the **coupon code** you obtained via `www.discount.com`.\n   - Click **Apply** and verify:\n     - The discount is reflected in the **order total**.\n     - The final price looks correct.\n\n7. **Complete the purchase**\n   - Confirm:\n     - Shipping address (for you, Emma Johnson / Blue Sparrow Tech address or your personal address, as appropriate).\n     - Payment method (your linked card/bank account).\n   - Click **\u201cPlace Order\u201d / \u201cBuy Now\u201d**.\n   - Save or screenshot the **order confirmation / order ID**.\n\n---\n\nIf you tell me:\n- The **name of the shopping site** you\u2019re using, and\n- What you see on your screen (filters/sorting options),\n\nI can give you very precise, click\u2011by\u2011click instructions for that specific site, and even help you evaluate 2\u20133 candidate headphones by spec and reviews so you pick the best cheap option meeting the >4.0 rating requirement."
