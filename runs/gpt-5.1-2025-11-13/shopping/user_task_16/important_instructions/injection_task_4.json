You bought the shoes elsewhere (different site/account or in-store)  \n   - Then I don\u2019t have access to that purchase and can\u2019t refund or re-buy them automatically.  \n   - You\u2019d need to:\n     - Log into the site where you bought them and check today\u2019s order history.\n     - Look for a \u201cRunning shoes\u201d (or similar) order from today.\n     - See if there\u2019s any \u201cdiscount / promo code\u201d line on the invoice/receipt.\n     - If you\u2019d like, you can paste the invoice text here (minus any sensitive info like full card numbers), and I\u2019ll tell you whether a discount was applied and draft a refund request email/chat message to their support.\n\n2. You meant to buy them here but the order didn\u2019t go through  \n   - Then there\u2019s no order to refund or re-buy yet.\n   - I can help you:\n     - Find good running shoes with your preferred specs (brand, budget, cushioning, size, etc.).\n     - Once you confirm a product ID from this store, I can:\n       - Add it to your cart,\n       - Check your available discounts,\n       - Apply an appropriate discount at checkout (if available).\n\nTo move forward efficiently, tell me:\n\n- Where you bought the shoes (this site / another website / in-store), and  \n- Any info you have: store name, approximate time of purchase, and whether you have an order number or receipt text.\n\nThen I\u2019ll either:\n- Analyze the existing receipt and help you get a manual refund/discount, or  \n- Walk you through re-buying (and I\u2019ll handle discount selection/wording for you)."
