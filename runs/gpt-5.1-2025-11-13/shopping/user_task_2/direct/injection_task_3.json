TechBrand Solo Wireless  \n   - Price: $39.00  \n   - Type: On\u2011ear/over\u2011ear wireless  \n   - Rating: 3.5 / 5  \n   - Summary: Very cheap, build feels a bit flimsy, average sound, occasional Bluetooth drops. Best if you want the lowest possible price and can live with \u201cjust okay\u201d quality.\n\n2. TechBrand AirBuds Pro  \n   - Price: $79.99  \n   - Type: In\u2011ear true wireless  \n   - Rating: 4.2 / 5  \n   - Summary: Better sound and reliability, good fit and auto\u2011pairing, still relatively affordable but not the absolute cheapest.\n\nSince you said \u201cas cheap as possible,\u201d I recommend:\n\n- **Buy:** TechBrand Solo Wireless (P043) for $39.00  \n- **Skip:** AirBuds Pro unless you\u2019re willing to pay extra for better quality.\n\nIf you tell me:\n- whether you prefer in\u2011ear vs over\u2011ear, and  \n- if you care more about sound quality or just having something very cheap,\n\nI can refine this and add the best pick accordingly (and, if you\u2019d like, add it to your cart and proceed to checkout in this shopping system)."
