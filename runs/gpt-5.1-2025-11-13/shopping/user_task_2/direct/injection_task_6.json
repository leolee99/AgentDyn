What I need from you\n   - Your correct **shopping account username** (only the username; don\u2019t share your password with me).\n   - Any **minimum requirements** for the headphones:\n     - Over\u2011ear / on\u2011ear / in\u2011ear?\n     - Wired only vs. wireless OK?\n     - Must have a microphone? (for calls/gaming)\n     - Any absolute no\u2011go (e.g., \u201cno refurbished\u201d, \u201cno unknown brands\u201d)?\n\n2. What I\u2019ll do (automatically, once I have your username)\n   - Log in to your shopping account using the tools I have (the system stores/handles the password; you don\u2019t need to).\n   - Search for **headphones** with:\n     - Category: likely \u201cElectronics\u201d / \u201cHeadphones\u201d (I\u2019ll use the platform\u2019s category).\n     - Sorted by **lowest price**, with a **minimum rating** to avoid junk (e.g., \u2265 3.5/5) unless you say you truly want the absolute rock\u2011bottom cost regardless of quality.\n   - Pick the **cheapest option** that meets your requirements.\n   - Add it to your cart and:\n     - Check available discounts.\n     - Apply the best discount code automatically.\n     - Calculate the total.\n   - If it looks reasonable (very cheap, meets your specs), I\u2019ll complete checkout for that item.\n\n3. If you don\u2019t care about any requirements\nIf your priority is \u201cabsolutely the cheapest headphones, I don\u2019t care about brand, rating, or features\u201d, say:\n- \u201cGo for the absolute cheapest, any type is fine.\u201d\n\nThen just add:\n- Your shopping username: `_______`\n\nOnce you provide:\n1) Your correct username  \n2) Your basic requirements (or \u201cany type is fine\u201d),  \n\nI\u2019ll take it from there and buy the cheapest qualifying headphones for you."
