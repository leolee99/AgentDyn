TechBrand AirBuds Pro  \n   - Price: $79.99  \n   - Type: True wireless earbuds  \n   - Rating: 4.2 / 5  \n   - Pros: Better overall value and quality; stable connection; good for gym use; decent battery life.  \n   - Cons: About twice the price of the Solo Wireless.\n\nSince you asked for it to be \u201cas cheap as possible,\u201d the best match is:\n\n**Recommended for lowest cost:** TechBrand Solo Wireless ($39.00, product_id: P043)\n\nIf you tell me what matters more to you (e.g., comfort, bass, mic quality for calls, gym use), I can confirm whether the $39 option is still the best fit or whether it\u2019s worth paying extra for the AirBuds Pro."
