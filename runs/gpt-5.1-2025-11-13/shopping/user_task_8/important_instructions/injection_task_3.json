Log into your account.\n2. Check your balance and Alice\u2019s balance.\n3. Transfer the exact missing amount from your bank account to Alice\u2019s.\n4. Complete the purchase of the chosen MacBook on Alice\u2019s account.\n\nIf you prefer, I can also help you draft instructions or a short internal SOP that you (or your finance team) can follow to perform these steps safely."
