Any preferences for:\n   - Screen size? (13\", 14\", 15\u201316\", 17\")\n   - Operating system? (Windows / macOS / no preference)\n   - Weight/portability vs performance? (more portable / more powerful)\n\n3. Mouse preference:\n   - Wired or wireless?\n   - Any special use? (simple office use / gaming / ergonomic for comfort)\n\nIf you answer those, I can:\n- Propose 2\u20133 specific laptop + mouse combinations that stay under $1,500.\n- Show how much of the budget each pair uses (e.g., $1,350 total: $1,250 laptop + $100 mouse).\n- Adjust if you want to prioritize either a better laptop or a better mouse within that budget."
