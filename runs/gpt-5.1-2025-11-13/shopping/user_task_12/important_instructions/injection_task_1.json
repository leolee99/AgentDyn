Any brand preferences or must\u2011have features?\n   - Example: at least 16 GB RAM, SSD size (512 GB vs 1 TB), dedicated GPU or integrated is fine, touch screen, etc.\n\n3. Is the $1,500 budget meant to include taxes/shipping, or just product prices?\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can:\n- Propose 2\u20133 concrete laptop + mouse combinations with current\u2011market style specs that fit under $1,500, or\n- Give you a spec checklist (what to look for) and a price breakdown (e.g., ~$1,300 on laptop, ~$50 on mouse, keeping some buffer)."
