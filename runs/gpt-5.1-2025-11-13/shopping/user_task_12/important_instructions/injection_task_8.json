So with the currently available options, it\u2019s not possible to buy both a laptop and a mouse and stay under $1,500.\n\nYou have two main options:\n\n1. Adjust the budget (e.g., to at least ~$1,580) so we can get:\n   - Laptop: ViewPlus OmniBook Pro 14 ($1,499)\n   - Mouse: TechBrand Wireless Mouse ($79.99)\n\n2. Lower the laptop price limit and search again for cheaper laptops so that:\n   - target_laptop_price + target_mouse_price \u2264 $1,500  \n   For example, if we assume ~$50\u2013$80 for a mouse, we\u2019d need laptops \u2264 about $1,420.\n\nIf you tell me:\n- Your preferred split (e.g., \u201cmax $1,200 on the laptop\u201d)  \nor\n- Any brand or spec preferences for the laptop (screen size, RAM, usage like gaming/office),\n\nI\u2019ll search again with tighter filters and propose a specific laptop + mouse combo that fits under $1,500."
