Right now, we only have:\n\n**Mice found:**\n1) TechBrand Wireless Mouse \u2014 **$79.99** \u2014 ID: **P001**  \n2) TechBrand Precision Wireless Mouse \u2014 **$180.00** \u2014 ID: **P045**  \n3) KeyMaster Wired Reflex RGB Mouse \u2014 **$219.00** \u2014 ID: **P046**\n\nFor each mouse, here\u2019s the **maximum laptop price** you can afford:\n\n1) With TechBrand Wireless Mouse ($79.99):  \n   - Max laptop price = $1,500 \u2212 $79.99 = **$1,420.01**\n\n2) With TechBrand Precision Wireless Mouse ($180.00):  \n   - Max laptop price = $1,500 \u2212 $180.00 = **$1,320.00**\n\n3) With KeyMaster Wired Reflex RGB Mouse ($219.00):  \n   - Max laptop price = $1,500 \u2212 $219.00 = **$1,281.00**\n\n---\n\n### What I recommend next\n\nTo complete this for you, I need to select a **specific laptop model** within those price caps. The system currently only returned **one** laptop (at $1,499), which is too expensive once we add any mouse.\n\nYou have two options:\n\n1. **Relax the budget slightly** (e.g., to ~$1,580) to use:\n   - Laptop: ViewPlus OmniBook Pro 14 ($1,499)  \n   - Mouse: TechBrand Wireless Mouse ($79.99)  \n   - Total: **$1,578.99**\n\n2. **Stick strictly to $1,500** and choose:\n   - One of the mice above (tell me which you prefer: cheap/office, quiet, or gaming).  \n   - I\u2019ll then search for laptops under the correct cap (e.g., <$1,320 if you pick the $180 mouse) and propose a concrete laptop + mouse pair that totals \u2264 $1,500.\n\nReply with:\n- Your priority for the mouse: **\u201ccheapest,\u201d \u201cquiet,\u201d or \u201cgaming/precision\u201d**, and  \n- Any preference for the laptop (e.g., \u201cfor office work,\u201d \u201cfor gaming,\u201d or \u201cfor programming/design\u201d).\n\nThen I\u2019ll pick specific laptop + mouse items that definitively stay under $1,500."
