Tell me which you prefer and I\u2019ll refine further (brand, size, etc.):\n\n## 1) Balanced setup (roughly $1,300\u2013$1,450 total)\nGood for work + light gaming / everyday use.\n\n- **Laptop**: ~$1,200\u2013$1,350  \n  - CPU: Intel Core i7 (12th/13th gen) or AMD Ryzen 7  \n  - RAM: 16 GB  \n  - Storage: 512 GB SSD  \n  - Screen: 14\"\u201315.6\", 1080p or better  \n  - Example types:  \n    - Dell XPS 13/15 (mid configs)  \n    - Lenovo ThinkPad T-series or X-series  \n    - ASUS Zenbook/ Vivobook (i7/Ryzen 7, 16GB, 512GB)\n\n- **Mouse**: ~$25\u2013$50  \n  - If you like wireless:  \n    - Logitech M720, M585 or similar  \n  - If you want productivity/multi-device:  \n    - Logitech MX Master (often on sale near $80\u2013$90, but we may need to choose a cheaper config to stay under $1,500 depending on the laptop price)\n\nThis keeps you **comfortably under $1,500** with a capable, future-proof laptop for most office tasks, coding, browsing, streaming, and some light creative work.\n\n---\n\n## 2) More performance laptop, cheaper mouse (aiming around $1,400\u2013$1,500)\nGood if you need more graphics power (e.g., design, some gaming).\n\n- **Laptop**: ~$1,350\u2013$1,450  \n  - CPU: Intel Core i7 / Ryzen 7  \n  - GPU: Dedicated GPU (e.g., RTX 4050 or similar midrange)  \n  - RAM: 16 GB  \n  - Storage: 512 GB\u20131 TB SSD  \n  - Example types:  \n    - ASUS TUF / ROG, Lenovo Legion, Dell G-series mid-level models\n\n- **Mouse**: ~$15\u2013$30 basic wireless  \n  - Logitech M185 / M190 or similar from trusted brands\n\nThis keeps the entire budget focused on the laptop, still not exceeding **$1,500 total**.\n\n---\n\nTo narrow this down and make it actionable, tell me:\n\n1. **Main use for the laptop** (office work, coding, photo/video editing, gaming, etc.)  \n2. **Preferred screen size** (13\u201314\" for portability, 15\u201316\" for comfort)  \n3. **Any brand preferences** (e.g., Dell, Lenovo, Apple, ASUS, HP)  \n4. **Preference for mouse type** (simple, ergonomic, gaming, multi-device)\n\nOnce you answer those, I\u2019ll:\n\n- Recommend 2\u20133 concrete laptop models and 1\u20132 mice,  \n- Verify that their **combined price is <= $1,500** by choosing appropriate price targets,  \n- Lay out a short \u201cshopping list\u201d you can use directly on any store."
