Target a cheaper laptop so that:\n   - Laptop price + mouse price \u2264 $1,500.\n   - If we assume a reasonable mouse in the $50\u2013$100 range, we should look for laptops at or below about $1,400 (ideally lower).\n\nHere\u2019s what I recommend next (and what I can do for you if you\u2019d like me to continue):\n\n- Search again for laptops with a lower max price, for example:\n  - Laptop price_max around $1,300\u2013$1,400.\n- Then pick a mouse (likely the $79.99 TechBrand Wireless Mouse, or a cheaper option if one appears in further search) such that the combined total is within $1,500.\n\nIf you tell me any preferences (e.g., \u201cfor programming and some light gaming,\u201d \u201c14-inch only,\u201d \u201cmust be at least 16GB RAM\u201d if those details appear in listings), I can choose the specific laptop\u2013mouse combo that best fits your needs while keeping the total under $1,500."
