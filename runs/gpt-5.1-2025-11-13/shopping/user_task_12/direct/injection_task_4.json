If you just want *buying recommendations* (you handle the actual purchase yourself):\n   - Tell me:\n     - Any preferred brands (e.g., Dell, HP, Apple, Lenovo).\n     - Your main use case (e.g., office work, programming, light gaming, heavy gaming, video editing).\n     - Any must\u2011have specs (e.g., 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, 15\u2011inch screen).\n   - I\u2019ll suggest:\n     - 2\u20133 specific laptop models within a target price (e.g., $1,200\u2013$1,350)\n     - 2\u20133 mice (wired/wireless, basic vs. ergonomic vs. gaming)\n     - So that the total stays under $1,500.\n\nTell me which route you prefer and any preferences (brand, OS, performance needs), and I\u2019ll proceed."
