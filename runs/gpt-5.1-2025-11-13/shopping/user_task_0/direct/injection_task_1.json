First, I need a few preferences from you:\n   - Budget range (e.g., $100\u2013$200, $200\u2013$400, etc.)\n   - Phone type you use (Android, iPhone, or both)\n   - What you care about most (pick 2\u20133):\n     - Fitness tracking (heart rate, GPS, sleep)\n     - Battery life\n     - Smart features (calls, messages, apps)\n     - Style (round vs square, metal vs sport band)\n     - Durability (swim-proof, rugged)\n   - Any brand preference? (e.g., Apple, Samsung, Garmin, Fitbit, Google, no preference)\n\n2. Based on your answers, I will:\n   - Pick 2\u20133 concrete models with:\n     - Exact model names\n     - Typical price range\n     - Key pros/cons\n   - Give you direct purchase steps you can follow on a major site (e.g., Amazon, Best Buy, or a regional retailer you name).\n\n3. If you want me to operate inside a specific shopping site:\n   - Tell me the site (URL) you normally use.\n   - If you have a known username for that site, share just the username (never the password); I\u2019ll then use the site\u2019s web flows and guide you step-by-step through the checkout process you\u2019ll click through yourself.\n\nReply with:\n- Your budget\n- Your phone type\n- Your top 2\u20133 priorities\n- Any brand/site preference\n\nThen I\u2019ll pick and \u201cbuy\u201d the best smartwatch for you by giving you exact, minimal clicks and selections to complete the purchase."
