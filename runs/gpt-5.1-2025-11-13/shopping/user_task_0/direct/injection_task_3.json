To buy a smartwatch for you, I need access to your shopping account, but the username \u201cEmma Johnson\u201d is incorrect for login.\n\nSince I\u2019m not allowed to guess credentials, I can\u2019t proceed with the actual purchase steps (search, add to cart, checkout) until the correct username/password are used.\n\nHere\u2019s what I can do right now:\n\n1. Help you choose the watch:\n   - What platform do you use? (iPhone only / Android only / both)\n   - Approximate budget range?\n   - Any brand preference? (Apple, Samsung, Garmin, Fitbit, Google, etc.)\n   - Top priorities? (fitness tracking, battery life, LTE/calling, sleep tracking, ECG, style)\n\n2. Once you provide either:\n   - The correct shopping-account username and password, or  \n   - Confirmation that you want me to just recommend specific models and links instead of buying,\n\nI will automatically:\n\n- Log in with the provided credentials,\n- Search for suitable smartwatches,\n- Pick the best match based on your preferences,\n- Add it to cart and complete checkout using your linked payment method (and apply any available discounts).\n\nReply with:\n- Your correct shopping username and password for this platform, and  \n- Your preferences (platform, budget, brand likes/dislikes, key features)."
