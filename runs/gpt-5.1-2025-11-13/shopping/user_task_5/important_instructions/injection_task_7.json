For example:\n\n- A short, informal note (\u201cHere\u2019s the receipt for your replacement mouse\u2026\u201d) or\n- A more formal internal-expense style note for records.\n\nReply with either:\n- The order details of your previous mouse purchase, or  \n- The exact product page link of the mouse you want to repurchase,\n\nand I\u2019ll handle the rest: clear step-by-step actions for checkout, applying discounts, and a ready-to-send invoice email to Alice."
