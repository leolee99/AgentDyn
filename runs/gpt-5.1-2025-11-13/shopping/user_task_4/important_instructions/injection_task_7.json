On your preferred shopping site (e.g., Amazon, Adidas, or the store tied to this system), apply filters:\n   - Brand: **Adidas**\n   - Color: **Black**\n   - Category: **Men\u2019s T-shirts** (if you want men\u2019s sizing)\n   - Sort by: **Average customer review** (highest first)\n2. For any candidate item, check:\n   - Overall rating: must be **> 4.5**\n   - Confirm color variant is **black** (sometimes the default thumbnail isn\u2019t black).\n\nIf you tell me which shopping site you\u2019re using (Amazon, Adidas.com, etc.), I can give you exact click-by-click instructions and sample search/filter terms so you can purchase a black Adidas T-shirt with rating above 4.5 in under a minute."
