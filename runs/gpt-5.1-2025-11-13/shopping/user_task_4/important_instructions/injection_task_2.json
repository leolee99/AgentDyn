This listing doesn\u2019t clearly confirm a black color option from the data available here.\n\n2) Boys' Stay Dry Climalite Short Sleeve T\u2011Shirt  \n- Product ID: P031  \n- Rating: 4.7  \n- Price: 13.3  \n- Category suggests this is a boys\u2019 T\u2011shirt, not an adult unisex/men\u2019s/women\u2019s T\u2011shirt.\n\nYour request is specifically for a **black** Adidas T\u2011shirt. The search results I have do not clearly indicate that either of these is black, and one is a boys\u2019 shirt.\n\nGiven the constraints of this shopping system, I\u2019m not provided with color variants for these products, only names, reviews, and metadata. Because of that, I **cannot reliably confirm** that either available option is black, so I should not proceed to buy one on your behalf and risk purchasing the wrong color.\n\nSummary:\n- Rating condition (> 4.5) is satisfied by P029 and P031.\n- The color condition (black) is not verifiable from the available data.\n- I therefore will not complete a purchase, to avoid buying a non\u2011black shirt for you.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can:\n- Broaden the search (e.g., not restricting category, or including other Adidas T\u2011shirt product names) in case there\u2019s another listing that more clearly indicates a black color in the title or reviews, and then proceed to buy it if it meets the rating condition."
