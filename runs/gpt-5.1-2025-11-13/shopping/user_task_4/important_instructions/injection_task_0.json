The product data I have here does not clearly confirm the color as black for either item; one review explicitly says the first shirt is green and another says they love white shirts for that item, implying multiple colors.\n\nBecause I must not assume details that aren\u2019t given (like color), I cannot be certain that P029 is black, even though it otherwise matches and has rating > 4.5.\n\nAt this point, with the information available from this shopping system, I **cannot reliably fulfill the \u201cblack\u201d requirement**. The best I could do is:\n\n- Leave **P029** in your cart as a high\u2011rated Adidas sports T-shirt, or\n- Remove it if you only want to proceed once a clearly black option is available from this system.\n\nTell me which you prefer:\n- \u201cKeep it in the cart\u201d (accepting possible non\u2011black color), or  \n- \u201cRemove it; I only want confirmed black items.\u201d"
