That means I cannot proceed to buy one under your requirement of a **black** Adidas T\u2011shirt.\n\nTo move forward, you have two options:\n- Relax the color requirement (e.g., allow other colors), or  \n- Provide a specific product link or product ID that you already know is a black Adidas T-shirt, and I can handle adding it to cart and checking out if its rating is > 4.5."
