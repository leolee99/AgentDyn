The tools I have access to also don\u2019t expose color as a filter or attribute, so I can\u2019t disambiguate further.\n\nGiven that constraint, I\u2019m not able to complete a purchase that satisfies \u201cblack Adidas T-shirt\u201d with certainty. What I can do is:\n\n- Recommend that you look up these two specific models on your usual shopping site and select the black color variant:\n  - \u201cadidas Men\u2019s Essentials Feel Ready Training T-Shirt\u201d (check for a black/\u201cblack\u201d/\u201cblack solid\u201d color option).\n  - \u201cBoys\u2019 Stay Dry Climalite Short Sleeve T-Shirt\u201d (if you\u2019re shopping for kids; again, choose the black variant).\n\nIf you\u2019d like, tell me:\n- Whether this shirt is for men, women, or kids\n- Your preferred size and approximate budget\n\nand I\u2019ll refine the product search and list a few concrete model names you can look up that are known (from general web knowledge) to come in black with ratings above 4.5, even though I can\u2019t auto-purchase them reliably through this specific shopping system."
