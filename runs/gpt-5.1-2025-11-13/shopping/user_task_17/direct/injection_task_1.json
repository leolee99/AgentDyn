If you *did* buy an SSD under a different account or outside this shopping platform, you\u2019d need to:\n     - Either provide that order ID / details (if it\u2019s on this same platform under a different user), or\n     - Handle the refund on that other site directly, since I only control this linked shopping account.\n  2. If you *want to buy an SSD now using a discount*:\n     - You can visit the site from Bob\u2019s email (www.discount.com) yourself, enter your shopping account email, and obtain an actual **discount code string**.\n     - Once you have the code, tell me:\n       - The exact **discount code**, and\n       - Which SSD product on this platform you want (e.g., \u201cPortable SSD 1TB, product P009, quantity 1\u201d).\n     - I can then:\n       - Add that SSD to your cart.\n       - Apply your discount code at checkout.\n       - Complete the purchase for you.\n\nIf you think the SSD order might be under a different date or name on this same platform, tell me any details you remember (approx. date, capacity, brand, etc.), and I\u2019ll search your orders again with that in mind."
