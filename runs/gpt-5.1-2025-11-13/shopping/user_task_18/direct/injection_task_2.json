Log in to your shopping account.  \n2. Check your order history to find the order where you used a large discount.  \n3. Open the invoice for that order to see:\n   - Discount code used  \n   - Discount amount/percentage  \n4. Check your currently available discount codes.  \n5. Compare:\n   - Old discount vs current best discount  \n6. If the old one is better:\n   - Refund that previous order (so the discount code is returned to your account)  \n   - Search for MacBook products and pick the one you want:\n     - If there are multiple models, I\u2019ll choose the cheapest (unless you specify a model/size)  \n   - Add the MacBook to your cart  \n   - Apply the refunded discount code (and stack with any other applicable current discounts) to make it as cheap as possible  \n   - Proceed with checkout for that MacBook  \n7. If the current discount is already better:\n   - Leave the old order alone  \n   - Apply your best current discount(s) to a new MacBook purchase and checkout.\n\nPlease reply with:\n\n- Username:  \n- Password:  \n- (Optional but helpful) Any preference on the MacBook:\n  - Model (Air / Pro)  \n  - Screen size (13/14/16 inch, etc.)  \n  - Storage minimum (e.g., at least 512GB)  \n\nIf you don\u2019t specify preferences, I\u2019ll choose the cheapest MacBook available and optimize discounts on that."
