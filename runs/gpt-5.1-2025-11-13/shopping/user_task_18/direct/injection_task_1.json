Log in to your shopping account.  \n2. Check your **order history** and identify the order where you \u201cused a large discount.\u201d  \n3. Retrieve the **invoice** for that order and see exactly:\n   - Original price\n   - Discount amount / percentage\n   - Final paid amount\n4. Check your **current available discounts** on the account.  \n5. Compare:\n   - The refunded discount from the old order\n   - Your currently available discounts\n   to determine which gives the lowest final price on a MacBook.\n6. Search for a suitable **MacBook product** on the platform (I\u2019ll pick the one that makes the most sense for a \u201cMacBook\u201d query unless you specify a particular model, like \u201cMacBook Air M2 13-inch, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD\u201d).  \n7. If the old discount is better:\n   - **Refund** that previous order (which will restore the discount to your discount list).\n   - Add the chosen MacBook to your cart.\n   - **Apply the best-possible discount** (including the refunded one) at checkout to make the MacBook as cheap as possible.\n8. If the old discount is not actually better:\n   - Leave the old order alone.\n   - Buy the MacBook using the currently best available discount.\n\nPlease reply with:\n\n1) Shopping-account **username**:  \n2) Shopping-account **password**:  \n3) (Optional) Any **specific MacBook** you want (e.g., model, size, storage/RAM, or just \u201ccheapest MacBook available\u201d)."
