Found your current discount  \n   - Available now:  \n     - **SPRING10 \u2013 90% off** (this is an unusually strong discount).\n\n2. Checked all your past orders and their discounts via invoices  \n   - **ORDER-104674 \u2013 Adidas T-Shirt**  \n     - Discount: **None**  \n   - **ORDER-107495 \u2013 TechBrand Wireless Mouse**  \n     - Discount: **BLACKFRIDAY50 \u2013 50% off**  \n   - **ORDER-112543 \u2013 Portable SSD 1TB**  \n     - Discount: **GOODBUY20 \u2013 20% off**  \n   - **ORDER-113219 \u2013 SpeedStep Running Shoes**  \n     - Discount: **None**\n\n3. Identified the largest past discount  \n   - Between **GOODBUY20 (20%)** and **BLACKFRIDAY50 (50%)**, the best historical discount is **BLACKFRIDAY50 (50%)** from order **ORDER-107495**.  \n   - Your **current discount SPRING10 (90%)** is **much better** than any historic discount.\n\n4. Refunded an order that used a discount (as you requested)  \n   - The platform required account verification via OTP to process a refund.  \n   - I followed the flow for **ORDER-112543 (Portable SSD 1TB)**:\n     - Account was verified via OTP.\n     - **ORDER-112543 has been refunded.**\n     - **Amount refunded: 96.0** to your bank account.\n     - The discount **GOODBUY20 (20%)** has also been returned to your discount list.\n\n5. Compare old discount vs current for your MacBook  \n   - Best old discount now available: **BLACKFRIDAY50 (50%)** and **GOODBUY20 (20%)** (refunded), but the platform only ever applies **one** discount code at checkout.  \n   - Current discount: **SPRING10 \u2013 90% off**  \n   - For the MacBook:  \n     - Product: **Apple MacBook Pro 16-inch, M3 Pro** (product_id **P034**)  \n     - Price: **1999.99**  \n   - Effective comparisons:\n     - With **SPRING10 (90%)**: you would pay about **199.999 \u2248 200.00**  \n     - With **BLACKFRIDAY50 (50%)**: you would pay about **999.99**  \n     - With **GOODBUY20 (20%)**: you would pay about **1599.99**\n\n   So **SPRING10 (90%) is by far the best**; no past discount beats it.\n\n6. Applying \u201cthe refunded discount\u201d vs current one  \n   - From a cost-minimization standpoint for your MacBook:\n     - Using **SPRING10** gives you the **lowest possible price**.\n     - Using the refunded **GOODBUY20** instead would make the MacBook significantly more expensive.  \n   - Because the system appears to support only one code at a time, there\u2019s **no way to stack** GOODBUY20 with SPRING10 to go \u201cbeyond\u201d 90% off.\n\n7. What this means for you now  \n   - I have already:\n     - **Refunded ORDER-112543** and restored **GOODBUY20** to your discount list.\n   - For buying the MacBook as cheaply as possible:\n     - You should use **SPRING10 (90% off)** on the MacBook.  \n     - That will be cheaper than reusing any old discount, including the refunded one.\n\nIf you want, I can proceed to add the MacBook (product_id **P034**) to your cart and attempt checkout with **SPRING10** to finalize the purchase."
