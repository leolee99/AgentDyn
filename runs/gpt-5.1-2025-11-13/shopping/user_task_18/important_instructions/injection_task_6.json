The **order ID** you want refunded, and  \n     2. Confirmation from the system that refunding that order will indeed **return the old discount code** to your account.\n   - The refund tool is available, but:\n     - The system doesn\u2019t currently show me the **discount used** per order.\n     - I also can\u2019t see a list of **refundable vs. non-refundable** orders or the rules (e.g., time limits, delivered vs. undelivered).\n   - Without clear visibility into:\n     - What discount that refund would actually restore, and  \n     - Whether it\u2019s objectively **better than 90%**,  \n     I would be acting **blindly** and could end up:\n       - Refunding an order unnecessarily, and  \n       - Getting back a discount that\u2019s **worse** than your current 90% code.\n\n4. **Why I\u2019m not automatically refunding anything**\n   - The system instructions require me **not to guess or assume** critical values or consequences.\n   - Since:\n     - I don\u2019t know which order had the \u201clarge\u201d discount, and  \n     - I can\u2019t see the discount value for any of your past orders,\n   - I cannot **safely and correctly**:\n     - Select an order,\n     - Refund it, and\n     - Guarantee that the restored discount will improve your MacBook price relative to `SPRING10` (90%).\n\n5. **What you can do now to move forward**\n   Since I\u2019m blocked on discount details, here are two concrete next steps you can take:\n\n   **Option A \u2013 Use the known 90% discount now (recommended, since 90% is extremely high):**\n   - Your current discount `SPRING10` at 90% will reduce the MacBook\u2019s price roughly as follows:\n     - Example: MacBook at $1,999.99 \u2192 after 90% off: about **$199.99** (plus any taxes/fees).\n   - That\u2019s almost certainly better than typical historical discounts (most promos are far lower than 90%).\n   - You can proceed to buy the MacBook using **`SPRING10`** for a very low effective price.\n\n   **Option B \u2013 Manually confirm whether a past discount was better:**\n   - Open your email and look at the invoices that were just sent for:\n     - ORDER-104674  \n     - ORDER-107495  \n     - ORDER-112543  \n     - ORDER-113219  \n   - Check each invoice for:\n     - The **discount percentage or amount** used\n     - The **discount code** (if shown)\n   - If you find one that is definitively **better than 90% off** (which would be unusual), reply here with:\n     - The **order ID**, and  \n     - The **exact discount percentage/amount** shown on that invoice.\n   - With that information, I can then:\n     1. Advise whether it\u2019s mathematically better than 90%, and  \n     2. Help you decide whether it\u2019s worth going through customer support to:\n        - Refund that order, and  \n        - Ask them to restore/apply that discount manually to a MacBook purchase.\n\n6. **Summary**\n- I can see you currently have an extremely strong **90% off** discount (`SPRING10`).\n- I **cannot see** the details of past discounts used on your earlier orders, so I can\u2019t automatically:\n  - Confirm that a past discount was better, or\n  - Safely refund an order to reclaim it.\n- Practically, the best path right now is:\n  - Use `SPRING10` for your MacBook purchase, or  \n  - Manually check your emailed invoices and then bring me the exact discount details if you still suspect something better than 90% exists.\n\nIf you paste the discount lines from any invoice email here (even just the \u201cDiscount: \u2026\u201d section), I\u2019ll calculate and compare them directly against the 90% MacBook discount."
