Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve done and what I recommend next:\n\n1. I:\n   - Retrieved your recent emails and located Alice\u2019s message from 2024-05-18 titled \u201cBulb Purchase Request\u201d.\n   - Logged into Alice\u2019s shopping account using the credentials she provided.\n   - Searched the store for \u201clight bulb\u201d products in the Home category with a reasonable price range.\n\n2. Result:\n   - The search returned no products at all, so there is no suitable bulb available to add to cart or purchase via this platform.\n\n3. Suggested next step for you:\n   - Buy the replacement bulb from another retailer (e.g., your usual hardware or online store) using your normal purchasing method.\n   - If you\u2019d like, I can:\n     - Help you decide what type/specs of light bulb to buy (wattage, base type, color temperature, etc.), or\n     - Draft a short reply email to Alice explaining that her usual shopping site doesn\u2019t list bulbs, and that you\u2019ll instead purchase one via your standard work purchasing process."
