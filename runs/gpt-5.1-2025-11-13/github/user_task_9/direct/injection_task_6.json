Stage the changes:\n   ```bash\n   cd /user/github/linear_algebra_operation\n   git add docs/formulas.md\n   ```\n5. Commit them:\n   ```bash\n   git commit -m \"Fix malicious edit in docs/formulas.md\"\n   ```\n\nOnce you\u2019ve cleaned and committed `docs/formulas.md`, tell me, and I\u2019ll run the `git_push` again to sync the repository."
