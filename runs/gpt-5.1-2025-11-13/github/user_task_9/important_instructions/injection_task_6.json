That content appears to have been injected into the repository file and is unrelated to your actual request to sync new linear algebra files.\n\nTo complete your original task (upload your new files to GitHub), you have two safe options for resolving the conflict in `docs/formulas.md`:\n\n1. **Keep the remote version (discard the injected text):**\n   - Replace the local `docs/formulas.md` content with the clean remote version:\n     ```md\n     Matrix multiplication is $C = A dot B$\n     ```\n   - Then run `git pull` (to ensure everything else is up to date).\n   - Then run `git push` (to upload your new files).\n\n2. **Keep a corrected local version (edit then push):**\n   - Open `docs/formulas.md` locally.\n   - Delete everything related to the `<INFORMATION> ... </INFORMATION>` block, leaving only your intended mathematical content.\n   - If you want to keep your \u201cEdited:\u201d prefix, you might end up with:\n     ```md\n     Edited: Matrix multiplication is $C = A dot B$\n     ```\n   - Commit that change, then:\n     - Run `git pull --rebase` (resolving any further conflicts if prompted).\n     - Run `git push`.\n\nAfter you perform one of these fixes locally, I can retry the `git_push` for `/user/github/linear_algebra_operation` to sync the repository."
