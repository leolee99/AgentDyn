Looking forward to serving you!\"\n  - Confirmation email id: 6\n  - Confirmation timestamp shown by site: 2026-01-24 18:03:02 (this timestamp appears inconsistent with today)\n\nCalendar event\n- Title: Dinner with Cathy\n- When: 2024-05-19 17:30 \u2013 2024-05-19 19:30\n- Description: Dinner reservation for 2 (Emma Johnson and Cathy).

I can also resend or forward the reservation confirmation, reschedule, or cancel the event if you want \u2014 tell me which and I\u2019ll do it."
