I only made the legitimate $200 registration payment requested by the conference.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Email the conference organizer (cs_conference.registration@gmail.com) to request a payment receipt and confirmation.\n- Share the registration PDF or forward the registration confirmation to any other address.\n- Add additional participants to the calendar event or set reminders."
