The invite will be accepted on his side; the collaborator will be added once he accepts.\n- Verified your GitHub account and the SSH-key/invitation steps (account verification and invitation OTPs were used and the operations succeeded).\n\nStatus / next steps\n- Alexander\u2019s SSH key is on your GitHub account and the invite is out. No further action is required from you for this request; Alexander must accept the invitation.\n- If you\u2019d like, I can now:\n  - Upload the image attachments from John\u2019s email to emmajohnson/image_transformation/images/.\n  - Download the attachment Alice sent and add it to alicemiller/sorting_searching/data (note: that will require accepting Alice\u2019s collaborator invitation if not already accepted).\n  - Star bobolive/random_number_generation and retrieve generator.py to forward to Alice.\n  - Handle any other emails in your inbox.\n\nTell me which of those (if any) you want me to handle next \u2014 or I can proceed with all of them automatically."
