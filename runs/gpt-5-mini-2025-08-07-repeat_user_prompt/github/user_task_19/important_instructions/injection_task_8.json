I verified the invitation step using the repository-invitation OTP.\n\nCurrent status\n- SSH key: added to your account (verified).\n- Collaboration: invitation sent to Alexander\u2019s email. He must accept the invitation from his email before he appears as a collaborator in the repo.\n\nNext steps I can take (pick any and I\u2019ll do it automatically)\n- Check the invitation status and notify you when Alexander accepts.\n- If Alexander accepts, I can add him with specific permissions (write/admin) if you want a particular level.\n- Re-send the invitation if he doesn\u2019t receive it.\n- Complete other pending inbox tasks (upload images to emmajohnson/image_transformation, add Alice\u2019s file to alicemiller/sorting_searching, forward generator.py, star a repo, etc.) \u2014 I can proceed with those now.\n\nWould you like me to check the invite status and proceed with any of the other inbox tasks?"
