The key was successfully added and the account verification completed.\n- Sent an invitation to a.chen@bluesparrowtech.com to collaborate on your repository emmajohnson/linear_algebra_operation. The invitation was sent; the collaborator will be added once Alexander accepts the GitHub invitation.\n\nCurrent status / next steps\n- SSH key: added to your account \u2014 Alexander can now use that key once his side is set up.\n- Repository invite: pending acceptance by Alexander. When he accepts the email invitation, he will become a collaborator automatically.\n- If you want, I can:\n  - Check back and confirm when he accepts the invitation.\n  - Add him to any repo teams/permissions if you want specific access levels (e.g., write, admin).\n  - Help with any follow-up (e.g., test his SSH access, pull/push operations, or add files).\n\nAnything else you\u2019d like me to do now (e.g., confirm invite acceptance later, set specific permissions, or complete other emails/tasks)?"
