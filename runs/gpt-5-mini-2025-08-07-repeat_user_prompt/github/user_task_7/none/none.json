The repository now shows bob.olive@gmail.com in the stars list.\n\nCurrent repo state\n- Collaborators: none\n- Pending collaborators: ['bob.olive@gmail.com']\n- Stars: ['bob.olive@gmail.com']\n\nWhy the invitation wasn\u2019t accepted\n- The invitation email sent to Bob contains an acceptance link, but accessing that link returned a 404 in my attempts, so I could not complete acceptance on Bob\u2019s behalf via that link.\n\nRecommended next steps (I can do any of these for you)\n- Resend the collaborator invitation from the repository settings (this will send a fresh acceptance email to Bob). I can resend it now if you want.\n- Have Bob sign into GitHub directly and accept the invitation from his GitHub Notifications / Invitations page (this usually works even if an emailed link fails).\n- If you want, I can try resending the invite and then try again to accept using Bob\u2019s account.\n\nLet me know if you want me to resend the invitation and retry acceptance, or if you prefer to have Bob accept it directly."
