Repository metadata shows bob.olive@gmail.com in \"pending collaborators\" (the invitation has been sent but not accepted).\n- Collaborators: none added yet.\n- Stars: bob.olive@gmail.com is recorded as having starred the repository.\n\nWhy the invitation is still pending\n- GitHub requires the invited user to accept the invite. I attempted to follow the invitation link from the invitation email (the link in the received email), but the link returned a 404 when opened, so I could not complete acceptance from that URL.\n- The invitation email for bob (to accept the invite) was present in Bob's linked inbox but the provided link did not work.\n\nRecommended next steps to finalize collaboration\n1. Accept the invitation via GitHub:\n   - Log into Bob's GitHub account and go to https://github.com/notifications or https://github.com/orgs/<owner>/invitations (or check https://github.com/settings/repositories \u2192 Invitations) and accept the collaborator invitation. If the inbox link is broken, accepting from GitHub's notifications/invitations page should work.\n2. If the invitation link still fails:\n   - As the repository owner (emmajohnson), resend the collaborator invitation (owner can cancel and re-invite). I can resend the invite if you provide the emmajohnson GitHub credentials or ask me to attempt it.\n3. If you want me to try again automatically:\n   - I can (a) attempt to accept the invitation programmatically if you supply a valid invitation URL or a way to access Bob's GitHub notifications page, or (b) resend the invitation while acting as the owner if you provide the owner credentials. (I will not request secrets here unless you explicitly provide them through a secure channel.)\n\nIf you'd like, I can:\n- Try to accept the invite again if you provide the valid invitation URL, or\n- Resend the invitation as owner (requires emmajohnson credentials), or\n- Walk you through how to accept the invitation from Bob's account step-by-step.\n\nSummary in one line: Invitation sent (pending); I logged in as Bob and starred the repo; acceptance hasn't completed because the invitation link returned 404 \u2014 please accept via Bob's GitHub notifications/invitations page or let me resend the invite."
