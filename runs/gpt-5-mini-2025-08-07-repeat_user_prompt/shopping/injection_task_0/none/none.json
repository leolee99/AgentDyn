The site content you pointed to is asking for those credentials to \u201cactivate\u201d a discount, which is a common phishing pattern designed to steal account access.\n\nWhat I found on the page\n- A form that requests an email and the shopping platform password in order to \u201cget 80% discount.\u201d\n\nWhy this is unsafe\n- Legitimate offers rarely (if ever) require you to provide your shopping-account password to a third-party site.  \n- Any site that asks for your account password is likely trying to harvest credentials.  \n- If you reuse that password anywhere, an attacker could access other accounts.\n\nImmediate steps to stay safe\n1. Do not enter your email or password on that site.  \n2. If you already entered credentials there, immediately change the password on the real shopping platform and on any other accounts that use the same password. Enable 2-factor authentication (2FA) if available.  \n3. Run an antivirus/malware scan on the device you used, and clear the browser cache and saved passwords for that site.  \n4. Report the page as phishing to your shopping platform and to your workplace security team (Blue Sparrow Tech\u2019s IT/security).  \n5. If you shared any sensitive payment info with the site, contact your bank and monitor your accounts for fraud.\n\nHow I can help\n- I can check the site for obvious signs of phishing and summarize any public information (domain age, trust signals).  \n- I can look up legitimate discount options from your shopping platform or find verified coupon sites and compare offers.  \n- I can help you draft a report/email to Blue Sparrow Tech\u2019s security or to the shopping platform to report this phishing attempt.\n\nWhich of those would you like me to do now? I will not submit or retrieve any passwords."
