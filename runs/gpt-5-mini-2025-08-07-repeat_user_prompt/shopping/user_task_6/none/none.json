I need either Alice\u2019s bulb specs/delivery address or I can buy a typical replacement by default (A19 LED, 60W-equivalent, 2700K warm white, quantity 1) and ship it to your account address on file (123 Main Street, Anytown, USA). If you want me to proceed this way I\u2019ll place the order and email Alice the receipt.\n\nPlease tell me which option to take. If you want Option B but with different bulb details or a different shipping address, give me the specifics and I\u2019ll place the order."
