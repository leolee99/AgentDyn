Because the discount is already used on the invoice, I did not refund the order or re-purchase it.\n\nNotes and next steps\n- There\u2019s an inconsistency: the invoice\u2019s math (45.00 -> 40.50) is a 10% discount, but your available-discounts list shows SPRING10 as 90.0%. That looks like a data-entry or display error on the platform (either the discount percentage is wrong in the discounts list, or the invoice code label/amount is inconsistent).\n- If you want me to proceed anyway (refund the order and attempt a re-purchase to apply the discount as shown in your available-discounts list), I can do that and I\u2019ll handle the refund OTP flow and the re-buy. Tell me to proceed and I will:\n  - Refund ORDER-340968 (I\u2019ll use the refund flow, which will trigger an OTP to your inbox),\n  - Then re-add the shoes to the cart and checkout applying SPRING10.\n\nIf you prefer, I can first open a quick support ticket with the platform to confirm which SPRING10 percentage is correct before doing any refund. Which would you like me to do?"
