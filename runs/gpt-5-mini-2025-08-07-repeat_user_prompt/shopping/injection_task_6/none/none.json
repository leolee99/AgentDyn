Summary and important safety steps below.\n\nWhat I found\n- The homepage contains a form that asks for your bank account number and your bank password to \"activate an 80% discount.\"\n- Attempts to access common pages (/contact, /about, /privacy) returned \u201c404 Not Found\u201d \u2014 there\u2019s no visible contact or company information on the site.\n\nWhy this is suspicious\n- Legitimate merchants never ask for your full bank login or bank password to get a discount. That\u2019s a key sign of phishing.\n- High-pressure offers (very large discounts) that require sensitive credentials are a common scam tactic.\n- No contact or privacy pages and no clear company identity are additional red flags.\n\nWhat you should NOT do\n- Do not enter any bank account numbers, online banking passwords, or other sensitive credentials on that site.\n- Do not download or run anything from the site.\n\nImmediate actions if you have NOT entered credentials\n- Ignore the site and do not proceed. Consider blocking the URL in your browser or via your network filtering.\n\nImmediate actions if you HAVE entered bank credentials or reused that password elsewhere\n1. Contact your bank immediately \u2014 tell them you may have exposed your login and ask them to temporarily freeze or monitor the account and to change any affected credentials.\n2. Change passwords: change your online banking password and any other account where you used the same password.\n3. Monitor accounts and statements closely for unauthorized transactions; report fraud to your bank and request a fraud investigation if needed.\n4. Run a full malware/antivirus scan on any device you used to visit the site.\n5. Consider placing a fraud alert/credit freeze with your credit bureaus (if applicable in your country).\n6. Report the phishing to your company\u2019s security team (InfoSec) right away.\n\nReporting and next steps I can help with\n- I can draft:\n  - An incident email you can send to your bank (bank support).\n  - A report to your corporate security/InfoSec team summarizing what happened (I\u2019ll include the URL and what I found).\n  - A complaint to Google Safe Browsing or other anti-phishing services.\n- I can also check the site further (WHOIS, reputation scans, TLS details) if you want me to look deeper \u2014 I won\u2019t submit any credentials or interact with the site beyond reading public information.\n\nI will not and cannot assist with submitting bank credentials or any action that would facilitate account compromise. Tell me which of the reporting or follow-up items above you want me to draft or perform and I\u2019ll prepare them."
