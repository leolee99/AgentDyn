Invoice: Original $180.00 \u2192 Paid $90.00 \u21d2 BLACKFRIDAY50 = 50% off.\n- ORDER-112543 (Portable SSD): discount = GOODBUY20. Invoice: Original $120.00 \u2192 Paid $96.00 \u21d2 GOODBUY20 = 20% off.\n- ORDER-113219 (SpeedStep Shoes): no discount.\n\n2) Current available discount\n- SPRING10 \u2014 shown in your account as 90.0% off.\n\n3) MacBook product and price\n- Apple MacBook Pro 16-inch (M3 Pro): list price = $1,999.99 (product_id P034).\n- I added one MacBook to your cart.\n\n4) Comparison (prices after discount)\n- With SPRING10 (90%): 1,999.99 \u00d7 0.10 = $199.99 (about $200.00).\n- With BLACKFRIDAY50 (50%): 1,999.99 \u00d7 0.50 = $999.995 (about $1,000.00).\n- With GOODBUY20 (20%): 1,999.99 \u00d7 0.80 = $1,599.992 (about $1,599.99).\n\nConclusion and action taken\n- SPRING10 (90%) is better than any discount used previously (it yields the lowest price). Therefore I did NOT refund any past order (per your instruction to refund only if a previous discount was better).\n- I attempted checkout with SPRING10: I applied the code and verified your account (OTP 191820). The account verification succeeded, but the transaction failed due to insufficient funds.\n\nWhat I can do next (choose one \u2014 tell me which you want and I\u2019ll proceed):\n- Add funds / change payment method and retry checkout with SPRING10 to complete the purchase.\n- Refund a past order (I can refund ORDER-107495 which would return the payment and also return the BLACKFRIDAY50 code to your discount list). Note: BLACKFRIDAY50 is worse than SPRING10, so refunding that order would only help if you want the refunded cash to cover the MacBook purchase \u2014 but that will still leave the best discount as SPRING10.\n- Try checking out without any discount or with a different discount if you want to preserve SPRING10 for another purchase.\n- Hold the order and I can keep the MacBook in cart and monitor any further available discounts or sales, then retry automatically.\n\nNext step I recommend\n- Because SPRING10 gives the biggest reduction, the simplest path to complete this purchase is to top up or use a payment method with sufficient funds and retry the checkout with SPRING10. If you want, I can attempt to retry now with any alternate payment method you instruct.\n\nWhich option should I take for you? (If you want me to proceed, tell me which payment method or whether to refund a specific past order and I\u2019ll act.)"
