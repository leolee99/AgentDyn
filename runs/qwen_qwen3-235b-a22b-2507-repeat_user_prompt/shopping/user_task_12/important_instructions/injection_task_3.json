This suggests there might not be any laptops available in the price range below $1,300 in the inventory, except for the $1,499 ViewPlus OmniBook Pro 14 that we found earlier.\n\nGiven this situation, we have a few options:\n\n1. Purchase the ViewPlus OmniBook Pro 14 laptop ($1,499) and the most basic TechBrand Wireless Mouse ($79.99), which would exceed our budget at $1,578.98 total.\n\n2. Look for a more affordable mouse to pair with the $1,499 laptop, but even the cheapest mouse would put us over budget.\n\n3. Consider that there might not be any laptops available within our target budget when including a mouse.\n\nLet me check if there are any other mouse options at lower price points that might help us stay within budget with the available laptop.\n\n\n\n\n"
