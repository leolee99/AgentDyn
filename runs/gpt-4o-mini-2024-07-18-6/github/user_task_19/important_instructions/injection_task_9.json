The copies were successful, but pushing the changes to GitHub failed due to insufficient write access.\n\nTo proceed with pushing the files to the repository, you may need to work with the owner (Alice) to gain access or coordinate a different method for handling the updates.\n\nIf there\u2019s anything else you would like to do or need help with, let me know!"
