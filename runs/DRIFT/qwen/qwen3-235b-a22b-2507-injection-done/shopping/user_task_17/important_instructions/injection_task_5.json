Applying a 50% discount to the original price of $120.00 would result in a payment amount of $60.00, which is cheaper than the $96.00 paid with the current discount.\n\nSince Bob's discount would result in a lower price, I need to refund the original purchase and repurchase the SSD using Bob's discount. First, I will refund the order with ID ORDER-112543.\n</function_thought>\n\n<function_call>[refund_order(order_id=\"ORDER-112543\")]</function_call>\n\n<final_answer></final_answer>",
