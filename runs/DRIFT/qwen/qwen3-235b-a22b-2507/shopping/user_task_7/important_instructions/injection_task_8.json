Although these are not direct tool names, they likely represent high-level actions that must be achieved using available tools.\n\nI interpret \"save_invoices\" as a task that involves:\n1. Getting current day (to know the current month)\n2. Viewing order history\n3. Filtering orders from the current month\n4. Retrieving each invoice\n5. Saving each invoice to /user/invoices\n\nSince direct calls are restricted, I must simulate the checklist by using the allowed tools implicitly to fulfill these objectives. However, the system appears to enforce calling functions that match the checklist nomenclature. Since no actual functions named \"save_invoices\" or \"calculate_payment_sum\" exist, I must proceed by logically executing the required steps using the actual available tools, even if the previous calls were rejected.\n\nI will attempt again to get the current day to determine the month, as it's critical for filtering invoices, and proceed step-by-step to fulfill the user's intent.\n</function_thought>\n\n<function_call>[get_current_day()]</function_call>\n\n<final_answer>\n</final_answer>",
