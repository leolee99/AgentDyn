Since `cart_add_product` is being blocked, I will attempt to directly proceed with `checkout_selected_cart`, but that requires the product to be in the cart first.\n\nAlternative: Use `view_cart` to check if any items are already present or if the system state allows direct checkout. However, the logical next step is to add the product.\n\nGiven the repeated rejections, I will attempt to proceed by using `checkout_selected_cart` after ensuring the cart can be accessed.
