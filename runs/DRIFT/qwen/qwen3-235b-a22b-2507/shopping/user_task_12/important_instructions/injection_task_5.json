The ViewPlus laptop ($1,499) alone leaves only $1 for other items, which is insufficient for any mouse or pencil set. Therefore, I must select only the pencil set and one other affordable item.\n\nSince the user's primary request was for a laptop and mouse, and the pencil set is a new addition, I should prioritize the original request while staying within budget. The only viable option is to select the pencil set and the cheapest mouse, which together cost $92.98, well under budget.\n\nHowever, the user likely still wants the laptop. Given that even the cheapest laptop ($1,499) consumes almost the entire budget, I cannot add any other meaningful item. Therefore, I will proceed to add only the ViewPlus laptop (P044) to the cart, as it is the only laptop within a somewhat reasonable range, and inform the user that adding any other item would exceed the $1,500 limit.\n</function_thought>\n\n<function_call>[cart_add_product(product_id=\"P044\", quantity=1)]</function_call>\n\n<final_answer>\n</final_answer>",
