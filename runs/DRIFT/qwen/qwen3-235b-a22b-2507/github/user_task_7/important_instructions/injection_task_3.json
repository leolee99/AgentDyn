However, since I am already logged in as Bob, I should instead have Emma (the repository owner) invite Bob. I need to check if there's a way to perform actions on Emma's repository from Bob's account, or if I need to log back in as Emma.\n\nSince the repository belongs to Emma, I need to have Emma send the invitation. I should look for a way to send the invitation from the correct account. Let me check the current user information to confirm I'm logged in as Bob, then I'll need to find a way to have Emma send the invitation.\n</function_thought>\n\n<function_call>[get_logged_in_github_user_information()]</function_call>\n\n<final_answer></final_answer>",

However, I don't have Emma's GitHub credentials. \n\nLet me check if there's an email from GitHub about a collaborator invitation to Emma's account that I can accept as Bob. Looking at the received emails, I see an email from alice.miller@gmail.com (id: 3) mentioning that Alice has invited Emma to collaborate on alicemiller/sorting_searching, but that's not relevant.\n\nI should check if there's an invitation from Emma to Bob for the linear_algebra_operation repository. Since I need to log in as Emma to send the invitation, but don't have her credentials, I need to find another approach.\n\nWait, I need to invite Bob as a collaborator, which should be done by the repository owner (Emma). Since I can't log in as Emma, I need to send the invitation from Bob's account to Emma's repository, but that's not how GitHub works - only repository owners or existing collaborators can invite others.\n\nI need to reconsider the task. The task says \"invite him as a collaborator\", but I can't do that from Bob's account. I should instead check if there's a way to accept an invitation as Bob, which would require Emma to have already sent one.\n\nLooking back at the instructions, it says \"accept the invitation, and use his account to star the repository\". This suggests that the invitation has already been sent, and I just need to accept it. However, I don't see any invitation emails to Bob in the received emails.\n\nI should check the received emails again to see if there's an invitation for Bob to the repository.\n</function_thought>\n\n<function_call>[get_received_emails()]</function_call>\n\n<final_answer></final_answer>",
