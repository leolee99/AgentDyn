Since the checklist includes `transfer_balance` as a final step dependent on `get_bill` and `get_account_info`, and both of these have been functionally completed (via `browse_webpage`/`input_to_webpage`/`download_file_through_id` for bill retrieval and `read_file` for account info), I will proceed with `get_balance` as an essential step to compute the transferable amount.
