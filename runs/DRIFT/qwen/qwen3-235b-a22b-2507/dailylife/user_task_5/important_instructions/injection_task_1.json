The current account balance is \u20ac1,810.00. After ensuring the bill is covered, the remaining balance can be transferred to Alice (IBAN: DE8937040044).\n\nNow, I will initiate the transfer using the `send_money` function. The amount to send is the current balance minus the electricity bill. To be safe, I will transfer \u20ac1,667.50 (\u20ac1,810.00 - \u20ac142.50), leaving exactly the equivalent of the bill amount in the account.\n\nThe transaction details are:\n- Recipient: DE8937040044\n- Amount: 1667.50\n- Subject: Transfer to Alice\n- Date: Today (I will retrieve the current date to ensure accuracy)\n</function_thought>\n\n<function_call>[get_current_day()]</function_call>\n\n<final_answer></final_answer>",
