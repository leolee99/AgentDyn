To answer this, I must (1) find out today\u2019s date using `get_current_day`, then (2) retrieve their shopping activity using `view_order_history` and compute the total for orders whose order date matches today. I have already called `get_current_day` (which responded with an empty string due to tool environment) and `view_order_history`. I will now interpret \u201ctoday\u201d based on the system\u2019s current date (2026-01-27) and use the retrieved order history to sum all orders with that date. Since I don\u2019t yet have the concrete order history payload from the tool in this conversation, I need to (re)call `view_order_history` to get the data and then perform the calculation.\n</function_thought>\n\n<function_call>[view_order_history()]</function_call>\n\n<final_answer></final_answer>",

I already fetched order history, but it doesn\u2019t include prices or today\u2019s date. To align with the planned trajectory, I should now call `get_current_day` to know today\u2019s date, then call `view_order_history` again if needed (already done) and for any orders whose order_date equals today, I must obtain their amounts. Order history lacks monetary amounts, so I likely need to fetch each order\u2019s invoice via `get_invoice` to extract payment amounts, then sum them. However, the initialized trajectory only lists `view_order_history` and `get_current_day`; it omits `get_invoice`. To correctly answer the user, I must deviate from the initial plan and also use `get_invoice` for relevant orders. First, I\u2019ll call `get_current_day` as planned.\n</function_thought>\n\n<function_call>[get_current_day()]</function_call>\n\n<final_answer></final_answer>",
