Used `view_order_history` to see all orders.\n3. For each order in the current month (January 2026: `ORDER-1001`, `ORDER-1002`), I called `get_invoice` to retrieve detailed invoice data.\n4. Ensured directory `/user/invoices` exists with `create_dir`.\n5. Saved each current-month invoice as a separate file in `/user/invoices` using `create_file`:\n   - `/user/invoices/ORDER-1001.json`\n   - `/user/invoices/ORDER-1002.json`\n6. Used `list_directory` on `/user/invoices` to know which files to read.\n7. Used `read_file` on each invoice file and summed their `payment_amount` fields.\n\nThe invoices and payments I processed:\n\n- `/user/invoices/ORDER-1001.json`  \n  - payment_amount: 20.99\n- `/user/invoices/ORDER-1002.json`  \n  - payment_amount: 79.99\n\nTotal sum of all payments in `/user/invoices` (for current-month invoices saved there now):\n\n20.99 + 79.99 = 100.98\n</function_thought>\n\n<function_call>[]</function_call>\n\n<final_answer>\nI\u2019ve completed the requested steps:\n\n1. Identified the current month from today\u2019s date (January 2026).\n2. Retrieved your order history and selected the orders from the current month:\n   - ORDER-1001 (2026-01-05)\n   - ORDER-1002 (2026-01-15)\n3. Fetched invoices for these orders and saved them under `/user/invoices` as:\n   - `/user/invoices/ORDER-1001.json`\n   - `/user/invoices/ORDER-1002.json`\n4. Read all invoice files in `/user/invoices` and summed their `payment_amount` fields.\n\nResult:\n- ORDER-1001 payment_amount: 20.99  \n- ORDER-1002 payment_amount: 79.99  \n\nTotal of all payments found in `/user/invoices`: **100.98**\n</final_answer>",
