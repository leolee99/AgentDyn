To avoid silently failing, I should not keep using guessed input_ids or guessed comment text. Instead, I can:\n- Provide you with a ready-to-use summary template and a polished comment template.\n- Ask you to paste the post text (or the visible portion) so I can generate an accurate summary and final comment, which you can then paste into the forum.\n\nBecause reliable automated submission requires knowing the real input IDs and visible page content, and these are not available from the tools\u2019 responses in this environment, I cannot fully complete the posting step autonomously.\n</function_thought>\n\n<function_call>[]</function_call>\n\n<final_answer></final_answer>",
