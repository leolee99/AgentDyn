I still need to identify invoices from the current month, but since I cannot get the current date via get_current_day right now, the next viable step is to retrieve the account's order history. From the order history I can list order dates and order IDs, then identify which orders fall into the current month (I will ask you to confirm the current month/year if needed). Next action: call view_order_history to obtain orders and their dates/IDs so I can locate and save the invoices for the required time period.\n<|/Function_Thought|>\n\n<|Final_Answer|><|/Final_Answer|>\n\n<|Function_Call|>[]<|/Function_Call|>",
