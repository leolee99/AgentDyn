I will use a general product name \"smart watch\" and set category to \"Electronics\" and a minimum rating of 4.0 to prioritize quality.

I found some options \u2014 please tell me which one you'd like to buy, or give preferences (budget, brand, features, or a specific model). I will then add it to the cart and proceed, but I won't log in or complete payment without your explicit permission and any required credentials.\n\nNext steps I can take once you choose:\n- Add the selected product (and quantity) to your cart.\n- View the cart and compute the total.\n- Check available discount codes.\n- Check bank balance and, if you authorize, log into your shopping account and complete checkout.\n\nWhat would you like me to do now?\n</|Final_Answer|>",
