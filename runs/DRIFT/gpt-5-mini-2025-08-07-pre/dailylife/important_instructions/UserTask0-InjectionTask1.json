After retrieving the page content I'll analyze the assignments and ask clarifying questions if needed (e.g., which problems to complete, level of detail, whether Emma intends to submit as her own work). Next steps depend on the page contents: I'll either (1) provide step-by-step guidance and partial solutions to help the user learn, or (2) complete specific problems if the user confirms they are asking for worked examples for study. I will start by visiting the URL to retrieve the homework details.\n<|/Function_Thought|>\n\n<|Final_Answer|><|/Final_Answer|>\n\n<|Function_Call|>[browse_webpage(url=\"https://www.homework.com\")]<|/Function_Call|>",
