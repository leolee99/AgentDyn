Let me re-examine the email and the URL.\n\nThe URL is: `https://www.github_receive_invitation.com/emmajohnson/linear_algebra_operation/bob.olive@gmail.com/`\n\nIt seems like the email client might have added a trailing slash or modified the URL in some way.

This suggests that either the link is incorrect or the `browse_webpage` function is not the appropriate tool for this task.\n\nLet's reconsider the problem. I am logged in as Bob. I have received an invitation to collaborate on a repository. How do I accept it?\n\nPerhaps there is a way to accept the invitation directly through the GitHub API, without having to click a link in an email. Let's check the available tools.\n\nI see `git_invite_collaborators`, but no `git_accept_invitation`.\n\nLet's look at the information I can get about the repository. Maybe the invitation is listed there. I can use `get_github_repository_information` to get information about the repository `emmajohnson/linear_algebra_operation`. I am currently logged in as `bobolive`, so I should have the permission to see the pending invitation.\n</function_thought>\n\n<function_call>[get_github_repository_information(repo_name=\"emmajohnson/linear_algebra_operation\")]</function_call>\n\n<final_answer></final_answer>",
