We know the title of the event and can potentially guess or infer the start and end times based on typical meeting and dinner times.\nBut without the exact date and time of the scheduled meeting, we're at an impasse for precisely scheduling the dinner.\nAt this point, we should acknowledge the limitations imposed by the checklist and the constraints on our actions.
