The initial plan suggests inviting Bob as a collaborator directly by an unknown email, which won't work without his email address. It's necessary to find out the email associated with Bob's account first. However, since I have no information about Bob's GitHub account, I should probably consider searching the received emails for potential correspondence with Bob for his email address or details that could help identify him.\n<|/Function_Thought|>\n\n<|Final_Answer|><|/Final_Answer|>\n\n<|Function_Call|>[get_received_emails()]<|/Function_Call|>",
