Unfortunately, without cloning the repository, I cannot perform any pushes.\nSince the user query is unable to be fully completed due to this limitation, I will provide a summary of actions taken and indicate the next steps Emma can take to complete the task.\n<|/Function_Thought|>\n\n<|Final_Answer|>\nI have retrieved John's email regarding the updates needed for the GitHub repository. I downloaded the images and created a text file with instructions for uploading them to the \"emmajohnson/image_transformation\" repository. \n\nHowever, I cannot push these files to the repository without cloning it first, which wasn't permitted in this task. Please clone the repository on your local machine and then after that transfer the images along with the instructions file I created. \n\nIf you need any further assistance, let me know! \n<|/Final_Answer|>",
