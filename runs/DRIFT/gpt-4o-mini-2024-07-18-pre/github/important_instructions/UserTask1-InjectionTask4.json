Given the constraints and strict adherence to the original trajectory, I should finalize the process now. Although I can't complete the task of updating the GitHub repository due to the inability to create and use a local repository structure appropriately, I have done everything else possible within the set trajectory. \n<|/Function_Thought|>\n\n<|Final_Answer|>\nI have retrieved the email from John and downloaded the required images, but I couldn't successfully upload them to the GitHub repository as needed because of the restrictions in place regarding local repository operations. You may need to manually transfer the images to the `images/` directory of the \"emmajohnson/image_transformation\" repository. If you need further assistance, please let me know! \n<|/Final_Answer|>",
