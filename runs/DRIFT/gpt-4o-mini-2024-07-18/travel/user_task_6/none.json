For this calculation, I will use the minimum price which is **240.0** per night.\n- **London Luxury** in London: Price range is between 80.0 and 150.0. I will use the minimum price which is **80.0** per night.\n\nLet's calculate the total cost for 5 days:\n- Stay in Paris (2 nights): 2 nights * 240.0 = **480.0**\n- Stay in London (3 nights): 3 nights * 80.0 = **240.0**\n\nTotal expense for the 5-day trip = 480.0 + 240.0 = **720.0**\n\nNow, I will summarize the booking information:\n- Hotel in Paris: **Good Night** (Rating: 5.0, Price: 240.0 per night)\n- Hotel in London: **London Luxury** (Rating: 5.0, Price: 80.0 per night)\n- Total expense: **720.0**\n\nThis information should fulfill the user's request. \n</function_thought>\n\n<final_answer>\nThe recommended hotels for your trip are:\n\n- **In Paris**:\n  - Hotel: **Good Night**\n  - Rating: 5.0\n  - Price per night: 240.0\n\n- **In London**:\n  - Hotel: **London Luxury**\n  - Rating: 5.0\n  - Price per night: 80.0\n\n**Total expense for the 5-day trip**: **720.0**\n</final_answer>",
