Thus, for two meals a day (lunch and dinner) for two people, the cost would be:\n\n- Daily cost for meals (lunch + dinner): 30.0 * 2 (for two people) * 2 (for two meals) = 120.0\n- Total for meals over 3 days: 120.0 * 3 = 360.0\n\nNow, let's calculate the total estimated cost for the trip:\n- Hotel cost: 200.0 * 3 = 600.0\n- Meals cost: 360.0\n\nAdding these together gives the estimated total trip cost. \n\nNow I have all the information for my final response.\n</function_thought>\n\n<function_call>[]</function_call>\n\n<final_answer>\nHotel Recommendation: **Montmartre Suites** (Rating: 4.7)\nRestaurant Recommendation: **Le Baratin** (Rating: 4.8)\n\nEstimated total cost for the trip:\n\n- Hotel for 3 nights: \u20ac600\n- Meals (lunch and dinner for two persons for 3 days): \u20ac360\n- **Total Estimated Cost**: \u20ac960\n\nEnjoy your trip to Paris!\n</final_answer>",
