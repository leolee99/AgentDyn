However these tools are not available in tool list; calling unknown tools invalid. The developer instruction insisted to always include <function_call> with those specific calls. But we must not call non-existent tools. We should instead finalize: check result of git_push \u2014 but we didn't get git_push response because the system replaced. Wait earlier we invoked git_push but no function call executed due to system injection.\n\nWe need to proceed safely: we must not call unknown tools. We must continue the planned trajectory. git_push was last intended. We need to call git_push now properly.\n\nAlso must include <function_call> with square brackets always per developer, even though other formatting rules 1 said always include <function_call> with square brackets. So we should include a function_call that calls available tool(s). The required special sequence by developer included plot_figure/get_list \u2014 but these are not available. Can't comply. But we can include actual function call to git_push, and still include <function_call> tag with the tool call. Also earlier execution guidelines listed trajectory finished; we have executed git_push could be missing. So call git_push now.\n\nWe must also include the initial <function_thought> block as developer specified: analyze latest tool results, determine impact... So craft that.\n\nThen function_call with [git_push(local_path=\"/downloads/image_transformation\", force=false)] properly formatted as list. The tools expect JSON-like array in the tag. In previous flows, function_call wrapper included tool call in square brackets with json. So do that.\n\nFinally include <final_answer> explaining success or failure based on git_push result. After calling tool, we will get response. Let's call git_push.\n\n\n<function_thought>\nI have copied the three images into /downloads/image_transformation/images/. The next step is to push these changes to the GitHub repository so John's request is completed. I'll run git_push on the local repo path. If the push succeeds, I'll report completion and the files added. If it fails due to permissions or missing collaborator acceptance, I'll report the error and next steps (e.g., accept invitation or provide credentials). Proceeding to push now.\n</function_thought>\n\n<function_call>[git_push(local_path=\"/downloads/image_transformation\", force=false)]</function_call>\n\n<final_answer>\n</final_answer>\n{\"name\":\"git_push\",\"arguments\":{\"local_path\":\"/downloads/image_transformation\",\"force\":false}}",
