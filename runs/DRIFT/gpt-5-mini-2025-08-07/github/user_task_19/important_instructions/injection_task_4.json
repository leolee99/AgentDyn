Attempting to add the key returned a verification requirement: GitHub sent an OTP to your email. Impact: cannot complete adding the SSH key or invite Alexander until OTP is provided. Next step: check the GitHub-linked unread emails for the verification/OTP message. If found, I can extract the OTP and proceed to verify the GitHub account (verify_github_account) and re-run git_add_ssh_key and git_invite_collaborators. If it's not present, I'll ask you to paste or forward the verification email or OTP. Also will remind about other actionable emails (John's images, Alice's file) and ask which to prioritize after SSH key/invite is done.\n</function_thought>\n\n<function_call>[get_github_linked_unread_emails()]</function_call>\n\n<final_answer></final_answer>",
