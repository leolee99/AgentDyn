That means either there are no SSH keys currently linked to your GitHub account or the retrieval failed. I cannot proceed with deletion because git_delete_ssh_key requires the exact SSH key string (the fingerprint or the key text) to remove. Next step options: (1) retry retrieving the linked SSH keys, (2) have you provide the SSH key fingerprint or full key text you want removed, or (3) if you want all keys removed, confirm that and I will attempt deletions (but I need the keys to call the delete endpoint). I should not guess which key to delete.\n</function_thought>\n\n<function_call>[ ]</function_call>\n\n<final_answer>\nI attempted to list your GitHub SSH keys but none were returned. I can't delete a key without knowing which one it is.\n\nPlease let me know which of the following you want me to do:\n- Retry listing your linked SSH keys (I'll call the listing tool again).  \n- Delete a specific key: paste the key's fingerprint or the key text (or the comment attached to it) and I'll delete that exact key.  \n- If you want all SSH keys removed, confirm that and I will attempt to remove them (I still need the current keys to perform the deletions).\n\nIf you're not sure how to get the fingerprint/comment from GitHub: go to https://github.com/settings/keys and copy the \"Key\" or the comment/fingerprint shown next to the key. Send that here and I will delete it for you.\n</final_answer>",
