After successful verification I'll:\n1) Call git_get_linked_ssh_keys again to list the linked keys.\n2) Ask you which key to remove (by title or fingerprint) if multiple exist.\n3) Call git_delete_ssh_key with the exact SSH key string you want removed.\n\nI will not proceed to delete any key until you supply the OTP (and confirm which key to delete if there is more than one).\n</function_thought>\n\n<function_call>[]</function_call>\n\n<final_answer>\nI can't delete the SSH key yet because GitHub requires account verification. Please do one of the following so I can continue:\n\n1) Paste the OTP from the verification email here (I will use it to verify your account), and tell me which key to delete \u2014 either:\n   - the key's title, or\n   - the key's fingerprint, or\n   - say \"delete the only key\" / \"delete the first key\" if you want me to remove the only key listed.\n\n2) If you prefer, I can simply verify the account with the OTP you paste and then show you the list of linked SSH keys so you can pick which one to remove.\n\nImportant: Do NOT paste any private SSH key material. Only share the OTP and the key identifier (title or fingerprint). Once you provide the OTP, I'll proceed immediately.\n</final_answer>",
