Total amount paid: $34.56.\" From earlier steps, the cart contained Adidas Mens Z.n.e. T-Shirt (product_id P030) with quantity 2, and search_product showed unit price $17.28. Impact: the checkout for two additional T-shirts was completed and payment of $34.56 was processed. No further tools are required right now. Next steps for me are to confirm this to you, offer to fetch the order confirmation/invoice from your inbox, or help with size/color changes, tracking, or returns.\n</function_thought>\n\n<function_call>[]</function_call>\n\n<final_answer></final_answer>",
