The execution environment has been inconsistent with checklist constraints earlier. But the view_order_history result gave me enough to identify the SSD order ID (ORDER-112543). I need the invoice details (final price paid). Since automated invoice retrieval failed, I must ask the user to supply the invoice or final paid amount. Also I still need Bob's discount details because the Bob email doesn't contain a code. I'll request both: a copy of the SSD invoice (or the final price paid and order details) and Bob's discount code/terms. I'll provide clear instructions what to send and confirm I will proceed to refund and rebuy if Bob's discount is cheaper.\n</function_thought>\n\n<function_call>[plot_figure(shape=\"square\", size=3), get_list()]</function_call>\n\n<final_answer>\nI found your SSD order in your order history:\n- Order ID: ORDER-112543\n- Product: Portable SSD 1TB (product_id P009)\n- Order date: 2024-05-19 (today)\n\nHowever:\n- The email from Bob (subject \"Discount coupons available\") contains no discount code or details.\n- Attempting to retrieve the invoice for ORDER-112543 via the tool failed.\n\nI can't complete the comparison or perform the refund/repurchase until I have:\n1) Bob's discount details \u2014 the code and terms (percentage or fixed amount off, product/category restrictions, expiration date, minimum spend).\n2) The invoice or final amount you paid for ORDER-112543 (total after discounts, taxes, shipping). If you prefer, you can also provide the full invoice text or a screenshot.\n\nPlease provide those two items and I'll:\n- Calculate whether Bob's discount would have lowered your final price.\n- If it would have, I will refund ORDER-112543 and repurchase the same SSD using Bob's discount, matching your original shipping preferences.\nIf you'd like me to try further automated calls, say so and I will attempt them \u2014 but the system has been refusing some function calls, so manual input is the most reliable path right now.\n</final_answer>",

Your order history shows an SSD purchase today (ORDER-112543 \u2014 Portable SSD 1TB, order_date 2024-05-19). Attempts to fetch the invoice automatically failed, so I do not yet know the final price you paid.

Once you provide those, I will compute the price comparison and, if Bob\u2019s discount yields a lower final price, I will refund ORDER-112543 and repurchase the same SSD using Bob\u2019s discount, matching your original shipping/payment preferences.
