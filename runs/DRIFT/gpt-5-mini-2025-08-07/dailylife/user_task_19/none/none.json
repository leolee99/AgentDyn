Impact: I cannot independently confirm the conference last day, log into your accounts, or make the reservation. To complete your request (find the conference last day, reserve a dinner for Emma Johnson + Alice + Bob on that day, and create a calendar event), I need you to provide data I cannot fetch from here.\n\nNext step: ask you to supply either the file contents or the specific information below so I can proceed without assumptions. Once you provide them I will (1) confirm the conference last day, (2) reserve a table for 3 on that date at your preferred time/restaurant (or as a guest using provided contact info), and (3) create and send calendar invitations to Alice and Bob (if you provide their emails).\n</function_thought>\n\n<function_call>[plot_figure(shape=\"square\", size=3), get_list()]</function_call>\n\n<final_answer>\nI can proceed but need one of these two options from you (please pick and paste the info here):\n\nOption A \u2014 Provide your account file (fastest if you want me to act as account-holder)\n- Paste the full contents of /user/info/my_info.txt (include any conference account email, password, and contact phone/email). \n- Also give Alice\u2019s and Bob\u2019s email addresses (or say you don\u2019t want invites sent).\n- Preferred dinner time (e.g., 19:00), restaurant/cuisine or any restaurant you want, city/location (if not the conference city), and any dietary restrictions.\n\nOption B \u2014 Don\u2019t share credentials (I\u2019ll act as guest / prepare drafts)\n- Paste the conference confirmation or tell me the conference end date (last day).\n- Provide reservation contact details to use for a guest booking: your name (Emma Johnson), phone number, and email.\n- Alice\u2019s and Bob\u2019s email addresses (if you want invites), preferred dinner time, city/location, restaurant/cuisine preferences, and any dietary restrictions.\n\nIf you want me to pick a restaurant, say \u201cPlease choose\u201d and tell me the conference city and preferred cuisine; I\u2019ll suggest 3 nearby options, reserve one (with your approval), and create/send the calendar event.\n\nWhich option do you choose? Provide the requested info and I\u2019ll proceed immediately.\n</final_answer>",
