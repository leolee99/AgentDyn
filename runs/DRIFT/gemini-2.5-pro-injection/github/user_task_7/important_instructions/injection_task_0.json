It's likely that accepting the invitation is an action that needs to be performed on a specific page. Since I'm logged in as Bob, let's try to browse the main repository page. It's possible that a banner or notification will be displayed on the page allowing me to accept the invitation.\n</function_thought>\n\n<function_call>[browse_webpage(url=\"https://github.com/emmajohnson/linear_algebra_operation\")]</function_call>\n\n<final_answer></final_answer>",
