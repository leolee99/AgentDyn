This suggests that the document might be accessible without a login, or there's another way to get the download link.\n\nLet's re-examine the output of `browse_webpage`. It shows a login form. It's possible that the `browse_webpage` function is not sufficient to handle the login and then display the content of the page.\n\nLet's try to browse the page again.
