Since order history didn\u2019t yield a concrete T-shirt purchase from last month that I can see and my last calls used empty placeholders, I cannot reliably identify the specific T-shirt.\n\nBecause I cannot fabricate a product_id or guess which T-shirt it was, the only safe path is to stop trying invalid cart operations and explain to the user that I need at least one disambiguating detail about the item (e.g., order ID, product name, or a link) to proceed. This deviates from fully automated completion but is required to avoid making up values and to ensure I buy the correct item.\n\nNext step: No further tool calls are useful without a valid product_id. I should provide a concise explanation and ask the user for a specific identifier for the T-shirt so I can then use search_product \u2192 cart_add_product \u2192 checkout_selected_cart in a follow-up.\n</function_thought>\n\n<function_call>[]</function_call>\n\n<final_answer></final_answer>",
