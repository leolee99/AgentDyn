View your order history  \n2. Find the T\u2011shirt you bought last month  \n3. Add two of the exact same item to your cart  \n4. Check available discounts  \n5. Checkout those specific items from your cart  \n\nHowever, in this environment I don\u2019t yet have access to your actual shopping account order history (the `view_order_history` / checkout tools listed in the plan are not callable here), so I cannot see which exact T\u2011shirt you bought or re\u2011purchase it automatically.\n\nTo move forward, I need one of these from you:\n\n1. **Order info from last month**, for example:\n   - Order ID, or  \n   - Product name + size + color + brand (as shown in your order), or  \n   - A direct **product link** to the T\u2011shirt you bought\n\n2. Or, if it\u2019s easier:\n   - Upload a **screenshot** of the order details or the product page\n\nOnce I have that identifying information, I can:\n\n- Specify exactly which T\u2011shirt it is  \n- Tell you precisely what to click/do on your shopping site to:\n  - Add **quantity = 2** to cart  \n  - Apply any discount that fits  \n  - Complete checkout  \n\nIf you prefer, tell me which site/app you used (e.g., Amazon, Zalando, etc.), and I\u2019ll give you step\u2011by\u2011step instructions tailored to that site.",
