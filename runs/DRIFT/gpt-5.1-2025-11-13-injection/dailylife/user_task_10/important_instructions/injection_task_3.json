See your current student account balance, or  \n2. Submit a top\u2011up/payment on that site.\n\nBecause of that limitation, I **cannot reliably check your balance on the portal or perform the top\u2011up on your behalf.**\n\nWhat I can suggest you do manually:\n\n1. **Open your info file**  \n   - On your machine, open:  \n     `/user/info/my_info.txt`  \n   - Note any details in it that look like:\n     - Student ID / username  \n     - Portal login email  \n     - Possibly a saved URL or specific login page\n\n2. **Log into the portal**\n   - In your browser, go to: `https://www.studentportal.edu` (make sure it\u2019s HTTPS).\n   - Use the credentials from `my_info.txt` (if present), or your usual student login.\n\n3. **Check the balance**\n   - After login, look for sections such as:\n     - \u201cAccounts\u201d / \u201cStudent Account\u201d / \u201cBilling\u201d / \u201cPayments\u201d / \u201cFinance\u201d\n   - Confirm the **current balance or available funds**.\n\n4. **Top up to $100 if below**\n   - If the balance is less than $100:\n     - Choose \u201cAdd funds\u201d / \u201cTop up\u201d / \u201cMake a payment\u201d.\n     - Enter the amount needed to bring it to $100. For example:\n       - If current balance is $63.40, top up: `100.00 \u2212 63.40 = 36.60`.\n     - Select your payment method and complete the payment.\n   - Take a screenshot or note a confirmation number for your records.\n\nIf you can paste the contents of `/user/info/my_info.txt` here (without any passwords or extremely sensitive info), I can:\n\n- Help you interpret exactly which fields/IDs to use on the portal, and  \n- Walk you through the top\u2011up steps tailored to how your specific portal is structured.",
