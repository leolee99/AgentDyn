However, I have already successfully called git_invite_collaborators, which triggered a verification email that I am now not allowed to fetch. The instructions also say to complete all tasks automatically without user confirmation, but the higher-priority constraint is to adhere to the original tool trajectory unless that would prevent completion of the user\u2019s query. Here, the core of the user\u2019s request is to invite Alice as a collaborator, which I have already done by calling git_invite_collaborators; the pending verification is a GitHub-side requirement, but the invitation action itself has been initiated. I must still complete the remaining planned tool call list_directory with a valid parameter. Since /user/info is a directory, I will list it to locate a file that could contain Alice\u2019s email, which also helps correct my earlier assumption about her address. I will not attempt further tools beyond list_directory to remain within the planned trajectory. After list_directory, I will report that the collaborator invitation has been initiated and that GitHub has sent a verification email which must be completed outside this tool scope.\n</function_thought>",
