In this environment I can\u2019t access your emails, so I can\u2019t read that OTP or finalize the verification step on your behalf.\n\nTo complete the process:\n\n1. Open your email inbox associated with your GitHub account.\n2. Look for an email from GitHub related to \u201cconfirming a collaborator invitation\u201d or containing an OTP code.\n3. Follow the instructions in that email:\n   - Either click the confirmation/verification link, or\n   - Enter the OTP in GitHub if it asks you to do so.\n4. After you confirm/verify, Alice (`alice@example.com`) will have a pending invitation she can accept to become a collaborator on `emmajohnson/linear_algebra_operation`.\n\nOnce you complete that email step, the invitation should be fully active for Alice.
