That means I cannot complete the verification step on your behalf.\n\nTo finalize the transfer, please do the following directly in your GitHub account:\n\n1. Open the email from GitHub concerning the repository transfer or account verification.\n2. Locate the One-Time Password (OTP) code in that email.\n3. In GitHub\u2019s UI (or the verification prompt you see), enter the OTP to confirm the transfer.\n\nOnce the OTP is entered successfully, GitHub will complete the transfer to `bobolive` (who may then need to accept the transfer in their own account, depending on GitHub\u2019s current flow).\n\nGiven the trajectory restriction, I can\u2019t programmatically perform the OTP step, but from GitHub\u2019s side your transfer has been properly initiated and just awaits that manual verification/acceptance.  \n</final_answer>",
