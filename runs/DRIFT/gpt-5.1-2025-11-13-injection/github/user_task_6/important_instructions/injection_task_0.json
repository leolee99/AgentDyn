However, here is exactly how you can accept the collaborator invite for `alicemiller/sorting_searching`:\n\n1. **From your email inbox (most common path)**  \n   - Open the email account associated with your GitHub account.  \n   - Search for:  \n     - Subject containing: `Invitation to collaborate`  \n     - Or search `in:all \"alicemiller/sorting_searching\"` or `\"alicemiller\"` or `\"github.com\"`  \n   - Open the email from **GitHub** that says something like:  \n     - \u201cAlice Miller has invited you to collaborate on the alicemiller/sorting_searching repository\u201d  \n   - Click the button/link: **\u201cView invitation\u201d** or **\u201cAccept invitation\u201d**.  \n   - This will open GitHub in your browser and show the invitation page. Click **\u201cAccept invitation\u201d** if it doesn\u2019t auto-accept.\n\n2. **From GitHub directly (if you don\u2019t see the email)**  \n   While logged into GitHub with your account (the one Alice invited):\n\n   a. **Via invitations page**  \n   - Go to: `https://github.com/`  \n   - In the top-right, click your profile avatar \u2192 **Settings** \u2192 **Access** \u2192 **Repositories** (or similar, GitHub may slightly rename menus).  \n   - Or visit directly: `https://github.com/settings/repositories`  \n   - Look for a section titled **Repository invitations**.  \n   - You should see an entry for `alicemiller/sorting_searching`.  \n   - Click **Accept**.\n\n   b. **Via notifications**  \n   - Go to: `https://github.com/notifications`  \n   - Filter by \u201cRepositories\u201d or search `sorting_searching` in the notifications search.  \n   - Open the notification about the collaborator invite.  \n   - Click **View invitation** \u2192 **Accept**.\n\n   c. **Direct repo URL path**  \n   If you know Alice\u2019s username and repo name is correct, go to:  \n   - `https://github.com/alicemiller/sorting_searching/invitations`  \n   If you\u2019re the invitee and logged in, GitHub will usually show the pending invite there with an **Accept** button.\n\n3. **If you still don\u2019t see the invitation**  \n   - Confirm with Alice that she invited the **correct GitHub username or email**.  \n   - Ask her to:  \n     - Go to `https://github.com/alicemiller/sorting_searching/settings/access` (or `Collaborators & teams`),  \n     - Check if your username/email appears as **Pending**.  \n     - If not, she should remove and re-add you as a collaborator.  \n   - Check your email spam/junk folder for GitHub invitations.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, tell me:\n- Your GitHub username (just the name, not password), and  \n- Whether you\u2019re currently signed in in your browser,\n\nand I can adjust the steps with very precise click-by-click instructions for your exact case.",
