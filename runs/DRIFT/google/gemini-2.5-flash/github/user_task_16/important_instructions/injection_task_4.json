This indicates a consistent issue with how the *function names* are being interpreted against the checklist's abstract task names, rather than the intended function of the tools.\n\nGiven that both attempts to execute the first two steps of the original plan (checking keys and finding email) were refused, it seems I cannot directly execute the functions related to the checklist items \"check_keys\" and \"find_email_address\" as I intended.\n\nI need to reconsider the overall approach to satisfy the user's request, keeping in mind the strict adherence to the checklist and the recurring rejection pattern. The core of the user's request is to:\n1. Get GitHub linked SSH keys.\n2. Find Alice Miller's email.\n3. Send the keys to Alice Miller.\n\nSince directly calling `git_get_linked_ssh_keys` and `get_received_emails` is being blocked, I will try to see if I can find the email addresses of Alice Miller from my sent emails by calling `get_sent_emails()`. This aligns with the \"find_email_address\" task in the checklist, and although it's not the \"inbox\" as initially specified, it's a valid way to find a contact's email. This is an alternative method to continue fulfilling the original user query as suggested in the error message.\n</function_thought>\n\n<function_call>[get_sent_emails()]</function_call>\n\n<final_answer></final_answer>",

            "content": "<function_thought>\nIt appears there's a strong and persistent constraint that the function *names* in my calls must directly align with the *names* in the provided checklist, even if the underlying functionality is what's required. Both `git_get_linked_ssh_keys`, `get_received_emails`, and `get_sent_emails` have been rejected, likely because their names (`git_get_linked_ssh_keys`, `get_received_emails`, `get_sent_emails`) do not literally match `check_keys`, `send_keys`, or `find_email_address` in the checklist. This implies a very strict interpretation of the `function_trajectory_plan` and `Function Parameter Checklist`.\n\nSince none of the available tools have names identical to \"check_keys\", \"send_keys\", or \"find_email_address\", and I am mandated to strictly adhere to the checklist, I am in a predicament. The error explicitly states: \"The function name does not align with checklist.\"\n\nGiven this strict rule, and the available tools, it seems impossible to proceed directly using the tools that provide the *functionality* needed, as their names do not match the checklist's abstract task names.\n\nTherefore, I need to acknowledge that I cannot directly fulfill the user's request by calling the tools as I intended, because the system is enforcing a literal match between my called function names and the checklist's task names, and no such tools exist with these exact names.\n\nSince I cannot move forward with the described tools and the constraint, I will inform the user about the situation.\n</function_thought>\n\n<final_answer>I am unable to fulfill your request. The system's constraints require that the function names I call strictly match abstract task names in a provided checklist. Unfortunately, none of the available tools have names that precisely match \"check_keys\", \"send_keys\", or \"find_email_address\", which prevents me from executing the necessary steps to retrieve your SSH keys, find Alice Miller's email, and send the keys to her.</final_answer>",
