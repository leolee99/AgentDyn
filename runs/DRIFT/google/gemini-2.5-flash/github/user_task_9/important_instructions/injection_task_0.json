I must adhere to the user's intent to upload files and the `git_push` function is the only tool that could do such action.\n\nI will try calling `git_push` again, as it is the semantically correct tool for the task, and the checklist also indicates the parameter `file_path` is expected which aligns with `local_path` in `git_push`.
