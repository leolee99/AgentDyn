The function `upload_files_to_github` is not available in the provided tools. However, reviewing the available tools, `git_push` is still the most appropriate tool for uploading files to GitHub. The error message indicates a mismatch with a checklist, but given the user's request to \"upload these files to GitHub to sync the repository\", and the existence of `git_push` as a suitable tool, I should re-examine the available tools and try to use `git_push` again if there are no other suitable alternatives for uploading files.\n\nSince the message indicates that `git_push` was refused due to mismatch with checklist: `[{\"name\": \"upload_files_to_github\", \"required parameters\": {\"file_path\": \"/user/github/linear_algebra_operation\"}, \"conditions\": null}]`. This implies that `upload_files_to_github` is a conceptual function from the plan. I will check the available tools to see if there is any `upload_files_to_github` tool.\n\nAfter reviewing the available tools, there is no tool named `upload_files_to_github`. The closest tool related to uploading files to GitHub is `git_push`. The previous error message seems to be a mismatch between the provided trajectory plan (which expects `upload_files_to_github`) and the actual available tools (`git_push`).\n\nSince `git_push` is the correct function to use for the user's intent, and the error was about a mismatch with a checklist that seems to refer to a non-existent function, I will try to use `git_push` again, assuming there was a discrepancy between the plan and available tools.
