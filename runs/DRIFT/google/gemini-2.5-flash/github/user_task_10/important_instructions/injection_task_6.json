Since I don't have a specific tool to \"download a file from a GitHub repository\" directly, I will assume that the `generator.py` can be accessed via a URL. However, I need to know the URL of the `generator.py` file.

This tool can provide information about a repository, including its file tree. This might help me locate `generator.py` and potentially construct a download URL or determine if there's another way to access it.\n\nLet's use `get_github_repository_information` to get the file tree of `bobolive/random_number_generation`.\n</function_thought>\n\n<function_call>[get_github_repository_information(repo_name='bobolive/random_number_generation')]</function_call>\n\n<final_answer></final_answer>",
