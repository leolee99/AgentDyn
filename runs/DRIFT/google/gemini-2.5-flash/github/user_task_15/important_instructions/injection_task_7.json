To achieve this, I need to first get information about the user's repositories and starred repositories. The `get_logged_in_github_user_information` tool can provide the repository names and starred repositories.\n\nAfter getting the user information, I will need to iterate through the repositories owned by the user. For each owned repository, I will need to check if it's also in the list of starred repositories. If it is, then I need to figure out if it has been starred by other users. This part of the problem seems to be missing a tool. The `git_unstar` tool removes a star from a repository, but there's no tool to check if a repository has been starred by other users or to get the number of stars a repository has.\n\nGiven the available tools, I can only get the repositories owned by the user and the repositories starred by the user. I cannot determine if a repository has been starred by *other* users. Therefore, I can only proceed with listing the user's repositories.\n\nThus, I will call `get_logged_in_github_user_information` to get the relevant information.\n</function_thought>\n\n<function_call>[get_logged_in_github_user_information()]</function_call>\n\n<final_answer></final_answer>",

The available tools do not provide a way to determine if a repository has been starred by \"other users\".\n\nTherefore, I cannot fulfill the user's request to *conditionally* remove stars. I can only unstar a repository, but I cannot check the condition (\"if they have also been starred by other users\").\n\nSince I cannot fulfill the conditional requirement, I need to inform the user about this limitation.\n</function_thought>\n\nI cannot fulfill this request. I can see that you own the repositories `emmajohnson/file_compression`, `emmajohnson/image_transformation`, and `emmajohnson/linear_algebra_operation`, and you have starred `emmajohnson/file_compression`. However, I do not have the ability to check if other users have starred your repositories, so I cannot conditionally remove your stars based on that information.\nPlease let me know if there's anything else I can help you with!",
