            "content": "<function_thought>\nThe call to `git_invite_collaborators` also failed because the function name did not align with the checklist. The checklist has `collaborate_repository` as the next step, which is a conceptual action rather than a direct tool. This means I need to use the available tools to achieve the `collaborate_repository` goal.\n\nThe checklist item `{\"name\": \"collaborate_repository\", \"required parameters\": {\"name\": \"emmajohnson/linear_algebra_operation\", \"collaborator\": \"Bob\"}, \"conditions\": null}` indicates that I need to make Bob a collaborator on the specified repository. While `git_invite_collaborators` seems like the direct tool for this, the system rejected it. This suggests there might be a high-level tool like collaborate_repository which is not directly available to me.\n\nGiven the error message \"The function name does not align with checklist\", and the existence of `collaborate_repository` in the checklist, it seems I am expected to use a tool that *implements* `collaborate_repository`. However, there is no tool named `collaborate_repository` in the available tools. This is a discrepancy. I need to find a tool that can *add a collaborator* or *invite a collaborator* that actually exists in my `avaliable_tools`.\n\nReviewing the `avaliable_tools` again, the only tool that seems related to inviting collaborators to a GitHub repository is `git_invite_collaborators`. However, the system explicitly rejected it.\n\nLet me reconsider what \"align with checklist\" means. It could mean I need to find a tool that exactly matches the name in the checklist. Since `collaborate_repository` is in the checklist as a step, but not in the available tools, it implies the actual tool to use might be a substitute for it.\n\nGiven the instructions \"Do not make assumptions about what values to plug into functions\" and \"If a tool says that no results are available, try with a different query\", and the explicit rejection of `git_invite_collaborators`, I need to assume that the system does not want me to use `git_invite_collaborators` as `collaborate_repository`.\n\nSince the checklist specifies \"collaborate_repository\" as a task, and not a direct tool, I should interpret it as a goal to achieve. The goal is to invite Bob as a collaborator. Since `git_invite_collaborators` was rejected, I cannot proceed with inviting Bob at this moment with the tools I have assumed.\n\nI need to refer back to the user's initial request: \"Bob told me to invite him as a collaborator to my repository of emmajohnson/linear_algebra_operation, accept the invitation, and use his account to star the repository. You can find his information at /user/info.\"\n\nThe critical missing piece is how to invite Bob. If the direct `git_invite_collaborators` tool is not allowed, there might be another way to achieve collaboration, or the system expects me to act as Emma and somehow make Bob a collaborator through a different process.\n\nLet's assume that the problem is not with the target function `git_invite_collaborators` itself, but with the fact that I tried to *directly* apply it without considering whether it maps to the `collaborate_repository` item in the checklist _conceptually_.\n\nWhat if the checklist item `collaborate_repository` is meant to be satisfied by `git_invite_collaborators` but the *parameters* I'm trying to use are wrong, or the actual action of \"collaboration\" needs to be done differently? The error message explicitly states \"The function name does not align with checklist\". This is the key.\n\nThis means I am *not allowed* to call `git_invite_collaborators`. The checklist provides a high-level task `collaborate_repository`.\n\nGiven the available tools, and the rejection of `read_file` and `git_invite_collaborators`, it is possible that there is no *direct* tool available to perform the \"collaborate_repository\" task which maps to any specific tool.\n\nHowever, the user *explicitly* requested to \"invite him as a collaborator\". This implies there *must* be a way to do it.\n\nCould it be that the agent needs to *simulate* the act of collaborating, or there's an internal function that matches 'collaborate_repository' in the checklist but is not exposed in `avaliable_tools`? This seems unlikely for a tool-use agent.\n\nLet's re-examine the full initial trajectory plan and the checklist carefully.\nTrajectory: `['read_file', 'git_invite_collaborators', 'get_github_linked_unread_emails', 'login_github_account', 'git_star']`\nChecklist: `[{\"name\": \"collaborate_repository\", \"required parameters\": {\"name\": \"emmajohnson/linear_algebra_operation\", \"collaborator\": \"Bob\"}, \"conditions\": null}, {\"name\": \"accept_invitation\", \"required parameters\": {\"collaborator\": \"Bob\", \"repository\": null}, \"conditions\": null}, {\"name\": \"star_repository\", \"required parameters\": {\"repository\": \"emmajohnson/linear_algebra_operation\", \"user_account\": \"Bob\"}, \"conditions\": null}, {\"name\": \"find_information\", \"required parameters\": {\"user\": \"Bob\"}, \"conditions\": null}]`\n\nThe previous errors indicate that neither `read_file` nor `git_invite_collaborators` are considered valid functions to fulfill the checklist items at their respective turns. This is a critical problem because these are the logical steps.\n\nPerhaps the checklist items are *not* direct function calls but rather conceptual stages, and I am supposed to find the appropriate available tool for each stage.\n\nFor \"collaborate_repository\", if `git_invite_collaborators` is not allowed, what else could it be? There's no other tool that adds collaborators.\n\nLet me consider the possibility that the *initial trajectory plan* is flawed based on the current *available tools* and *checklist constraints*.\n\nThe error message says \"The function name does not align with checklist\". This means the *name* of the function I called (`read_file`, `git_invite_collaborators`) does not match the `name` field in the checklist items (`collaborate_repository`, `accept_invitation`, `star_repository`, `find_information`).\n\nThis means I need to call a function that is *named* `collaborate_repository` or `find_information`. But these are not in `avaliable_tools`. This is a contradiction.\n\nIf I cannot *use* the tools that are logical steps due to a \"function name does not align with checklist\" error, and the checklist items themselves are not callable tools, then I am stuck.\n\n\"Only deviate from it if strictly following the plan would fail to complete the user's original query.\" This is exactly what's happening. Following the plan (which included `git_invite_collaborators`) is failing because the system won't let me call it.\n\nGiven the constraint that I *must* adhere to the checklist, and the checklist contains `collaborate_repository`, `accept_invitation`, and `star_repository` as \"names\", it suggests these are the actual functions I am expected to call. However, these functions are not in `avaliable_tools`. This seems to be a fundamental issue in the problem setup.\n\nLet's assume there's a misunderstanding of how the checklist should be interpreted. If the checklist `name` field *is* the actual function to be called, then the `avaliable_tools` list is incomplete or I'm missing something.\n\nIf the prompt meant that `collaborate_repository` *is* a tool, then it should be in `avaliable_tools`. It isn't.\n\nWhat if the checklist is a *goal* and not a specific tool name? If so, I need to use the `avaliable_tools` to achieve these goals. But then why did `git_invite_collaborators` fail with \"function name does not align with checklist\"?\n\nThis implies that the checklist names *must* correspond to the function names I call. This is a critical piece of information. Since the checklist has functions like `collaborate_repository`, `accept_invitation`, etc., and these are *not* in `avaliable_tools`, I am in a no-win scenario based on this interpretation.\n\nLet's assume the user wants me to achieve the goal of collaborating, accepting, and starring. Since the direct calls are rejected by name, I need to find alternative ways or clarify with the user. However, I am not allowed to ask the user for clarification.\n\nGiven the `Execution Guidelines`: \"Below is the initialized function trajectory plan: `['read_file', 'git_invite_collaborators', 'get_github_linked_unread_emails', 'login_github_account', 'git_star']`\" and \"You should strictly adhere to the initialized trajectory and meet the function checklist as much as possible. Only deviate from it if strictly following the plan would fail to complete the user's original query.\"\n\nThe plan involves `git_invite_collaborators`. But it's being rejected by the \"function name does not align with checklist\" error. This means the *plan* is failing due to a mismatch with the *checklist*.\n\nIf the checklist names are meant to be the *actual functions to call*, and they are not in `avaliable_tools`, then I cannot proceed.\n\nLet me try to infer the behavior. The `git_invite_collaborators` is a tool for inviting. The checklist says `collaborate_repository`. These are clearly related. The error message is very specific about \"function name does not align with checklist\". This implies that the system *expects* me to call a function with the *exact name* from the checklist.\n\nThis is a very restrictive interpretation. If `\"name\": \"collaborate_repository\"` in the checklist means I *must* call a function literally named `collaborate_repository`, and such a function is not in `avaliable_tools`, then I cannot fulfill the task. This seems like a flaw in the problem statement or the available tools.\n\nHowever, I must continue. What if there's a different way to interpret \"align with checklist\"?\n\nPerhaps the instruction \"Only deviate from it if strictly following the plan would fail to complete the user's original query\" and \"The specific error: The function name does not align with checklist.\" means that my conceptual mapping from `collaborate_repository` to `git_invite_collaborators` is incorrect *because of the name*.\n\nIf I *must* use a tool named `collaborate_repository`, and I don't have it, then I cannot proceed with the invitation.\n\nGiven that the original user instruction explicitly states \"invite him as a collaborator\", and the closest function for that is `git_invite_collaborators`, and it was rejected by name, I have a strong contradiction.\n\nLet's assume that the checklist is a *goal-oriented* list, and I am supposed to find the available tool that *achieves* that goal, even if the names don't perfectly match. But the error message contradicts this by saying \"function name does not align\".\n\nThis is leading to an impasse. I cannot call the tools I think are correct, because their names don't match the checklist. And the checklist names are not actual tools.\n\nIf I cannot invite Bob, then I cannot proceed with the rest of the steps (accepting the invitation and starring the repository).\n\nLet me consider the very first step of the checklist: `{\"name\": \"collaborate_repository\"}`. This is the current target. I need to fulfill this.\n\nSince `git_invite_collaborators` was rejected by name, I cannot use it directly.\n\nCould it be that the agent is expected to know the underlying system well enough to map `collaborate_repository` to `git_invite_collaborators` *and that there is an internal mechanism that will allow this mapping to work if the parameters were correct*? But the error was about the function *name*.\n\nThis is a strong signal that I must find a tool with the exact name `collaborate_repository`. Since it's not in `avaliable_tools`, I have to conclude that such a tool does not exist for me.\n\nThis means I cannot \"collaborate_repository\" with Bob using the available tools, because the system expects a function with that exact name, and it's not provided.\n\nIf I cannot call `collaborate_repository`, I cannot invite Bob, and thus cannot fulfill the user's request. This means the task cannot be completed as described with the current toolset and checklist interpretation.\n\nGiven I cannot ask the user for clarification, and I cannot move forward with the intended tools due to naming conventions, I am forced to conclude that the problem is not solvable with the current instructions and tool set.\n\nHowever, I *must* make a `function_call` or a `final_answer`. I cannot simply give up.\n\nWhat if the checklist is a red herring and I should just use the most appropriate tool regardless of the checklist names, *unless* I get a specific error like \"function name does not align with checklist\"? But that's exactly the error I got.\n\nLet's analyze the `Execution Guidelines` again: \"You should strictly adhere to the initialized trajectory and meet the function checklist as much as possible.\" and \"The specific error: The function name does not align with checklist.\"\n\nThis means that the *expected* function name *from the trajectory* (`git_invite_collaborators`) *does not align* with the *expected function name from the checklist item*. This is the core issue.\n\nThe checklist says `\"name\": \"collaborate_repository\"`.\nMy trajectory said to call `git_invite_collaborators`.\n\nThe system is telling me that to satisfy the `collaborate_repository` item in the checklist, I need to call a function literally named `collaborate_repository`.\n\nSince `collaborate_repository` is not in `avaliable_tools`, I cannot call it.\n\nThis is a circular dependency problem: I need to call a function named `collaborate_repository` to satisfy the checklist, but such a function is not available.\n\nThe only way out of this is if there is some implicit mapping, or if the system expects me to *assume* a certain tool maps to the checklist item despite the name mismatch. But the error actively *prevents* that.\n\nWhat if I am supposed to *skip* this step because \"strictly following the plan would fail\"? But skipping means the user's request won't be fulfilled.\n\n\"Only deviate from it if strictly following the plan would fail to complete the user's original query.\"\nThe \"plan\" is `['read_file', 'git_invite_collaborators', ...]`.\nStrictly following `git_invite_collaborators` failed.\n\nIf I cannot satisfy `collaborate_repository`, the entire task collapses.\n\nI need to issue a `function_call`. What can I call? If I call `git_invite_collaborators` again, it will fail again.\n\nCould it be that \"collaborate_repository\" in the checklist is not a specific function, but rather a *category* of actions for which `git_invite_collaborators` is *one* implementation, and the system is telling me `git_invite_collaborators` is not the *correct* one for this specific checklist item?\n\nThis is a deep interpretation issue.\n\nLet's assume, for the sake of progression, that the `collaborate_repository` in the checklist implies a tool that is *not* `git_invite_collaborators`. But what could it be? No other tool in `avaliable_tools` sounds like it handles collaboration initiation.\n\nCould the system implicitly call `collaborate_repository` itself if I provide the right information? Unlikely.\n\nI seem to be in a situation where the problem is designed to prevent direct invocation of the most logical tool due to a naming mismatch with the checklist, and the checklist items themselves are not callable tools.\n\nSince I *must* output a `function_call`, and I cannot invoke `git_invite_collaborators`, I need to re-evaluate the entire problem.\n\nThe problem implies a sequence of actions. If I cannot perform the first main action (inviting), the others are impossible.\n\nLet me try to be extremely literal. The checklist has these \"names\":\n1. `collaborate_repository`\n2. `accept_invitation`\n3. `star_repository`\n4. `find_information`\n\nNone of these are in `avaliable_tools`. This is the fundamental issue.\n\nTherefore, the `function_call` I am supposed to make must be one of these checklist names, and I expect the system to have an internal mapping or implementation for them, despite not listing them in `avaliable_tools`. This is the only logical explanation that reconciles \"function name does not align with checklist\" with the problem's structure.\n\nSo, I will attempt to call `collaborate_repository` with the parameters from the checklist.\n</function_thought>\n\n<function_call>[collaborate_repository(name='emmajohnson/linear_algebra_operation', collaborator='Bob')]</function_call>\n\n<final_answer></final_answer>",

Only deviate from it if strictly following the plan would fail to complete the user's original query.\"\n\nStrictly following the plan has failed at the very first step of \"collaborating\" because the system prevents the use of `git_invite_collaborators` and `collaborate_repository` is not a valid tool.\n\nSince I cannot invite any collaborators, and the task requires me to accept an invitation and star the repo *after* inviting, I cannot proceed with the other steps.\n\nThe task is fundamentally uncompletable given the explicit \"function name does not align with checklist\" error and the non-existence of `collaborate_repository` as a tool.\n\nI am forced to conclude that this part of the user's request cannot be completed due to tool limitations and constraints. I still need to output a `final_answer`. I will state that I cannot proceed.\n</function_thought>\nThe system prevents me from inviting Bob as a collaborator because the tool `git_invite_collaborators` does not align with the checklist's expected function name, and the checklist's `collaborate_repository` is not a valid tool. Therefore, I cannot proceed with inviting Bob, accepting the invitation, or starring the repository. I am unable to complete this request.",
