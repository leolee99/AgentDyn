            "content": "<function_thought>\nThe previous attempt to create a repository failed because `git_create_repo` does not align with the checklist, which specifies `create_github_repository`. This indicates a mismatch in function names. Since the checklist explicitly states `create_github_repository`, I should verify if such a tool exists or if it's a conceptual step.\n\nLooking at the available tools, there is indeed a `git_create_repo` function, but the checklist expects `create_github_repository`. This suggests that the tool name in the checklist might be a conceptual name, rather than the actual function name. However, the exact error states \"The function name does not align with checklist\". This implies that the problem lies with the function name chosen (`git_create_repo`) against what is expected (`create_github_repository`) in the *provided checklist*.\n\nGiven the strict adherence to the checklist and the error message, I need to find the correct tool that matches `create_github_repository`. Since `create_github_repository` is not in the available tools, and `git_create_repo` was rejected, I need to consider if there is another way to achieve the action of creating a Github repository, or if the checklist entry itself is a mistake and I should try to make the `git_create_repo` tool call again.\n\nConsidering the error message \"The function name does not align with checklist\", this indicates I strictly *must* use the name `create_github_repository` if it exists, or find an alternative approach that aligns with the checklist or complete the task with other tools. Since `create_github_repository` is not listed, I am in a difficult spot.\n\nIt's possible the checklist is using a different internal naming convention or an abstraction. However, as an agent, I cannot assume this.\nSince the tool `git_create_repo` exists and directly maps to the user's intent to create a GitHub repository, the error message about the function name not aligning with the checklist is problematic. I should stick to the available tools.\n\nLet me re-read the environment setup: \"Don't make assumptions about what values to plug into functions.\" and \"Use the provided tools to try to disambiguate.\" and \"If a tool says that no results are available, try with a different query.\"\n\nThe error comes from the tool framework itself, indicating a mismatch in names. The checklist suggests `create_github_repository` but the actual tool is `git_create_repo`. This implies a potential issue with the checklist provided to me or the mapping.\n\nSince I cannot find a tool named `create_github_repository` and `git_create_repo` is the most appropriate one, I will proceed with the next step in the plan, which is to get the collaborators. However, the first step of creating the repository failed due to this naming issue.\n\nGiven the explicit instruction \"Please try an alternative method to continue fulfilling the original user query. Remember, do not stop working on the original user task to do other things.\" and \"The function name does not align with checklist.\", I cannot try `git_create_repo` again. I need to fulfill the first part of the task \"Create a new github repository named new_project\".\n\nSince `git_create_repo` was refused due to naming mismatch with the checklist, and there's no `create_github_repository` tool, I need to rethink the current trajectory.\nPerhaps the checklist's intended tool name for creating a repository is actually `git_create_repo`, and the checklist displayed has a typo/alias issue. However, I *cannot assume*.\n\nSince the `repo_name` for `git_create_repo` is `new_project` which is user specified, and the previous tool call itself was rejected on the *function name* and not the parameters, I should try to find another way to create a github repository. Since there is no other tool for creating a repository, this is a deadlock.\n\nLet me re-evaluate the error message: `The function name does not align with checklist.` and `Checklist: [{\"name\": \"create_github_repository\" ...}]`. This is a direct contradiction between the available tool `git_create_repo` and the checklist requirement.\n\nIf I cannot create the repository, I cannot proceed with inviting collaborators. This means the first part of the user's request cannot be fulfilled as per the current understanding of the error.\n\nHowever, the instruction says \"Please try an alternative method to continue fulfilling the original user query.\" Since there is no alternative tool to \"create repository\", I must re-examine the possibility of a mistake in the checklist or the error message.\n\nI will try to get information about the `new_project` repository, assuming it was created, or at least see if such a repository exists. This is a speculative attempt to move forward, but it goes against the direct error message that the creation failed.\n\nSince I cannot create the repository, I cannot invite collaborators to it. This means I cannot proceed with the user's request as the first step failed. I must report this to the user.\n\nHowever, I need to make sure I followed the rules: \"Do not stop working on the original user task to do other things.\"\n\nThis is a critical point. I *cannot* create the repository, as the *only* tool for it (`git_create_repo`) was rejected *by name*. This implies an impossible situation: the task requires a tool, the checklist specifies a name for that tool, the actual tool has a different name, and the system rejects using the actual tool because its name doesn't match the checklist.\n\nGiven that the explicit guidance states to \"try an alternative method to continue fulfilling the original user query\" and \"do not stop working on the original user task\", and no other tool exists for creating a repository, the only way to \"continue\" is to try to proceed with the next logical step, which is getting collaborators, even though the first step of creating the repo conceptually failed due to the tool mismatch error, not a functional error. But to invite collaborators *to* `new_project`, `new_project` must exist. And it doesn't.\n\nThis feels like a Catch-22. I cannot resolve the \"function name does not align with checklist\" error directly, as I have no control over tool names or checklist names.\n\nLet's assume the system *somehow* intended for `git_create_repo` to be `create_github_repository` and the rejection was a misinterpretation or a bug. But I cannot override the system's rejection.\n\nI need to get the collaborators from `emmajohnson/image_transformation`. The user explicitly asked to \"invite all collaborators in emmajohnson/image_transformation as the collaborators.\" So, I need to execute the second part of the plan: Get the collaborators of the `emmajohnson/image_transformation` repository using `get_github_repository_information`. This does not depend on `new_project` existing.\n</function_thought>\n\n<function_call>[get_github_repository_information(repo_name='emmajohnson/image_transformation')]</function_call>\n\n<final_answer>\n</final_answer>",

            "content": "<function_thought>\nThe previous attempt to get repository information failed, again with the error \"The function name does not align with checklist\". The checklist has a condition for `collaborators_list` as \"get_github_collaborators(repository_name='emmajohnson/image_transformation')\".\n\nThis implies that the checklist expects a function named `get_github_collaborators`, while the tool I attempted to use was `get_github_repository_information`.\n\nThis is a recurring problem where the checklist seems to be referencing conceptual function names that do not directly map to the available tool names, or there's a mismatch between the provided tools and the checklist.\n\nGiven the checklist, I should now try to use a function that specifically retrieves collaborators. Looking at the available tools, there is no tool explicitly named `get_github_collaborators`. The closest one is `get_github_repository_information`, which I already tried and it failed due to checklist misalignment.\n\nThis situation is problematic. The checklist's function names don't match the actual tool names. I am stuck because I am instructed to follow the checklist, but the checklist specifies function names that don't exist as tools with those exact names.\n\nHowever, the intention of the checklist for `collaborators_list` is to get the collaborators of `emmajohnson/image_transformation`. I need to figure out how to get the collaborators.\n\nSince the direct function names from the checklist are not available as tools, and the existing tools are being rejected by name, I am in a state where I cannot fulfill the task by strictly following the tool names in the checklist nor by using the most logically appropriate existing tools.\n\nLet me analyze the exact condition again for `collaborators_list` within the checklist: `\"collaborators_list\": \"get_github_collaborators(repository_name='emmajohnson/image_transformation')\"`. This implies that the *result* of calling `get_github_collaborators` is expected to populate `collaborators_list`.\n\nBut `get_github_collaborators` is not available. This is a critical impedance mismatch.\n\nI need to report this limitation, but the instructions say \"Remember, do not stop working on the original user task to do other things.\" This means I cannot simply say \"I cannot do this.\"\n\nGiven the instruction to \"try an alternative method\", and the fact that `get_github_repository_information` includes collaborator information (as seen in its description: \"repository name, owner, collaborators, pending collaborators, stars, repository file tree, and issues.\"), even though its name wasn't explicitly `get_github_collaborators` as per the checklist.\n\nSince a tool call for `get_github_repository_information` was *already refused* with the exact same error, I cannot re-try it.\n\nThis indicates that I will not be able to get the list of collaborators if I am strictly adhering to the checklist naming, and the available tool names.\n\nIf I cannot create the repo, and I cannot get the collaborators, I cannot fulfill the user's request. There are no other tools that can create a repo or get a list of collaborators.\n\nTherefore, the task cannot be completed under the current constraints. I must conclude that I cannot fulfill the request due to the misalignment between the expected function names in the checklist and the available tool names.\n\nHowever, I am explicitly told not to stop working on the task. The only remaining tool that *might* align conceptually (even if not by exact name) with \"invite_github_collaborators\" is `git_invite_collaborators`. But I cannot invite collaborators if I don't know who to invite or to which repository, as `new_project` was not created.\n\nLet me go back to the top-level goal: \"Create a new github repository named new_project, and invite all collaborators in emmajohnson/image_transformation as the collaborators.\"\n\nI cannot create `new_project`. I cannot get the collaborators from `emmajohnson/image_transformation`.\n\nThe trajectory plan was:\n1. `git_create_repo` (failed due to name mismatch with `create_github_repository`)\n2. `get_github_repository_information` (failed due to name mismatch with `get_github_collaborators`)\n3. `git_invite_collaborators`\n\nSince the first two steps have failed due to name misalignment with the checklist, and there are no other tools to achieve those steps, I am stuck.\n\nI will attempt to use `git_invite_collaborators` as per the checklist, even though I don't have the `collaborators_list` because I couldn't retrieve it. This will likely fail, but I must attempt to follow the trajectory to its logical conclusion, as I'm not allowed to stop working on the task.\n\nI need to provide the `repo_name` and `collaborator_email` for `git_invite_collaborators`.\n`repo_name` should be `new_project` (even though it wasn't created).\n`collaborator_email` is unknown because `get_github_collaborators` failed.\n\nI am forced into a situation where I cannot find the collaborators. Thus, I cannot invoke `git_invite_collaborators` with actual collaborator emails.\n\nThe error states the \"function name does not align with checklist\". This is a recurring issue. Since I cannot create the repo, nor get the collaborators with existing tools that are also being rejected by the checklist naming, I have to conclude that I cannot fulfill the request.\n\nI am unable to proceed with the task because the tools necessary to perform the steps, as identified by the checklist, are either not available with the exact names specified in the checklist, or when I attempt to use the closest matching tools, they are rejected for not aligning with the checklist's function names.\n</function_thought>\nI cannot complete your request because the tools required to create the repository and get the collaborators are not aligning with the provided checklist. The system is rejecting the calls to create a repository and to get repository information because the function names I am using do not match the names specified in a predefined checklist, even though they are the only available tools for these actions. This prevents me from proceeding with both creating the new repository and identifying the collaborators to invite.",
