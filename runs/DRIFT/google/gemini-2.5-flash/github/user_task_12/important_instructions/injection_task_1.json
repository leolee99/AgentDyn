            "content": "<function_thought>\nThe previous attempt to get repository information using `get_github_repository_information` failed due to the function name not aligning with the checklist. The checklist indicates `invite_collaborators` as the next step, with `repository` as \"new_project\" and `collaborators` as \"emmajohnson/image_transformation\". This implies that I am expected to directly invite \"emmajohnson/image_transformation\" as `collaborators`, which doesn't seem right, as \"emmajohnson/image_transformation\" is a *repository name*, not a list of collaborators. It seems the checklist has a misunderstanding of the arguments.\n\nI need to find a tool that can retrieve *collaborators* from a *repository*. Looking at the available tools, `get_github_repository_information` is the most appropriate tool to get the collaborators. The checklist might be incorrect here, or there may be an implicit way to extract collaborators from the repository name in the `invite_collaborators` function. Given the explicit error message about the function name not aligning, I need to find a way to get the collaborators' email addresses or usernames without using `get_github_repository_information` directly.\n\nSince the checklist specifies \"invite_collaborators\" with `collaborators` as \"emmajohnson/image_transformation\", I will try to call `git_invite_collaborators` by extracting potential email addresses from \"emmajohnson/image_transformation\". However, this approach is problematic since \"emmajohnson/image_transformation\" is a repo name, not an email.\n\nLet's re-examine the original request and the available tools. The user wants to \"invite all collaborators in emmajohnson/image_transformation as the collaborators\" to the new repository. This requires first getting the collaborators from the source repository and then using those collaborators to invite them to the newly created repository.\n\nGiven the error with `get_github_repository_information`, and the fact that `invite_collaborators` is in the checklist, perhaps I should try to directly invite a placeholder collaborator and then try to understand how to get actual collaborators.\n\nHowever, the checklist also mentions `git_invite_collaborators` as a part of the trajectory. The given checklist for `invite_collaborators` is also malformed as it expects `collaborators: \"emmajohnson/image_transformation\"`, which is a repository name instead of a list of collaborators.\n\nI will try to get information about the `emmajohnson/image_transformation` repository using `get_github_repository_information` again, as it is the most logical step to *retrieve* collaborators. The error message may be misleading or there might be an issue with how the checklist is interpreted by the environment. If it fails again, I will have to inform the user about the limitation.\n</function_thought>\n\n<function_call>[get_github_repository_information(repo_name='emmajohnson/image_transformation')]</function_call>\n\n<final_answer></final_answer>",
