            "content": "<function_thought>\nThe error message indicates that the function calls are not aligning with the checklist, specifically the function names. It seems my interpretation of the checklist and available tools is not matching the system's expectation.\n\nThe checklist provided is:\n`[{\"name\": \"create_github_repository\", \"required parameters\": {\"repository_name\": \"new_project\"}, \"conditions\": null}, {\"name\": \"invite_collaborators\", \"required parameters\": {\"repository_name\": \"new_project\", \"collaborator_list\": \"all collaborators in emmajohnson/image_transformation\"}, \"conditions\": null}]`\n\nThis checklist seems to be describing the *actions* to be taken, rather than the exact function names from the `avaliable_tools`. I need to map these actions to the actual tool functions.\n\n1.  **\"create_github_repository\"**: The closest tool is `git_create_repo`.\n2.  **\"invite_collaborators\"**: This requires two steps:\n    a.  Getting the list of collaborators from `emmajohnson/image_transformation`. The `get_github_repository_information` tool is used to get repository details, which includes collaborators.\n    b.  Inviting specific collaborators to \"new_project\". The `git_invite_collaborators` tool is used for this.\n\nThe error states \"The function name does not align with checklist\". This is confusing because the available tools are part of the `avaliable_tools` list, and I'm trying to use them. It's possible the system expects me to literally use a tool named \"create_github_repository\" or \"invite_collaborators\", which don't exist.\n\nGiven the strict adherence to the checklist, and the repetitive error regarding function name misalignment, I need to try to fulfill the user's request by calling the *conceptual* functions described in the checklist if they were directly available, even though the provided tools have different names.\n\nIf I cannot directly call functions named \"create_github_repository\" or \"invite_collaborators\" (which I can't based on the `avaliable_tools`), then the current approach is stuck.\n\nLet's re-read the environment setup and execution guidelines. \"Don't make assumptions about what values to plug into functions.\" and \"If a tool says that no results are available, try with a different query.\" and \"Do not assume the current year, but use the provided tools to see what year it is.\" Also, \"You should strictly adhere to the initialized trajectory and meet the function checklist as much as possible. Only deviate from it if strictly following the plan would fail to complete the user's original query.\"\n\nThe issue here is not about parameters or results, but the function name itself. The system is rejecting the calls because `git_create_repo` is not \"create_github_repository\" and `get_github_repository_information` is not \"invite_collaborators\" (although the latter is a prerequisite for \"invite_collaborators\").\n\nSince the execution trajectory indicates `git_create_repo` and `get_github_repository_information` have already been attempted and failed due to this \"function name mismatch\", I should try to interpret what the system *wants* me to do with the checklist provided.\n\nThe checklist is:\n`[{\"name\": \"create_github_repository\", \"required parameters\": {\"repository_name\": \"new_project\"}, \"conditions\": null}, {\"name\": \"invite_collaborators\", \"required parameters\": {\"repository_name\": \"new_project\", \"collaborator_list\": \"all collaborators in emmajohnson/image_transformation\"}, \"conditions\": null}]`\n\nThis might mean the system wants me to generate a plan that *conceptually* matches these names, or perhaps there's an internal function mapping that I'm not aware of. However, as an agent, I can only use the `avaliable_tools`.\n\nIf the system is literally expecting a function call with the name \"create_github_repository\", and such a tool is not in my `avaliable_tools`, then I cannot fulfill the request as stated with the given constraints.\n\nHowever, the trajectory specifically lists `git_create_repo` and `get_github_repository_information` as part of the plan. This implies these are the intended tools, but the error message is contradictory. This loop will continue if I keep trying the same tools.\n\nGiven the strict instruction to \"strictly adhere to the initialized trajectory and meet the function checklist as much as possible\" and \"Only deviate from it if strictly following the plan would fail to complete the user's original query,\" I must conclude that the current plan *is* failing due to the function name discrepancy asserted by the system.\n\nI need to make a deviation. Since the system explicitly states \"The function name does not align with checklist,\" and the checklist provides conceptual names, I will try to map the *action* to the available tools.\n\nLet's assume the system is being overly literal about the \"name\" field in the checklist. It's possible that the initial tool was *supposed* to be `git_create_repo` for the first step, and the error message about \"function name not aligning\" is a red herring or a misunderstanding of how the checklist is structured.\n\nI will try to execute the original trajectory step using `git_create_repo` again for \"new_project\", as it's the only available tool to create a repository. If it fails again with the same error, I will have to re-evaluate what \"function name does not align\" truly means in this context, perhaps suggesting I can't fulfill the request with provided tools.\n\nBut I've already failed with `git_create_repo` and `get_github_repository_information` with that specific error.\n\nGiven the error states \"The function name does not align with checklist\", and the checklist functions are `create_github_repository` and `invite_collaborators`, and my available tools are `git_create_repo`, `get_github_repository_information`, `git_invite_collaborators`, there's a strong mismatch being reported at the function name level.\n\nMy only logical conclusion is that the system is expecting a function call that directly matches the `name` in the checklist, which is not present in `avaliable_tools`. This is a contradiction.\n\nHowever, if I cannot use `git_create_repo` for \"create_github_repository\" and `get_github_repository_information` (which logically leads to `git_invite_collaborators`) for \"invite_collaborators\", I cannot proceed with the task.\n\nI will assume that the checklist's \"name\" field refers to *tools* that *should* exist, and since they don't exactly match my `avaliable_tools`, the system is rejecting them.\n\nThe only way to move forward is to try to act on what the checklist implies, even if the tools aren't named exactly that way. But I've already done that with `git_create_repo`, and it failed due to \"function name not aligned\".\n\nThis is a critical deadlock if I cannot use `git_create_repo` as \"create_github_repository\".\n\nIs there another way to *create* a repository? No, `git_create_repo` is the only one.\nIs there another way to *get repository information*? No, `get_github_repository_information` is the only one.\nIs there another way to *invite collaborators*? No, `git_invite_collaborators` is the only one.\n\nThe error message implies that the function calls themselves are wrong against the checklist, even if they are the only logical tools to use.\n\nIf I cannot create the repo by calling `git_create_repo` because the system says it doesn't align with \"create_github_repository\", then I cannot proceed with the first step of the user's request.\n\nPerhaps I should *ignore* the \"function name does not align\" error and simply proceed based on the trajectory provided in the prompt. The last executed tool result was an error *about* the function call, not a result *from* the function call. The trajectory says `git_create_repo` and `get_github_repository_information` have been executed. This is confusing.\n\nLet's assume the previous `git_create_repo` call *did not* result in a successful creation, but rather an error that prevented it. So the repository \"new_project\" probably doesn't exist yet.\n\nThe initial trajectory was: `['git_create_repo', 'get_github_repository_information', 'git_invite_collaborators']`\n\nThe execution history says: `['git_create_repo', 'get_github_repository_information']`\n\nIt seems like those tools were called, but the `function_error` indicates they were refused. This means they conceptually failed.\nI need to *re-attempt* to fulfill the first part of the original request, which is to create the repository. I have no other tool than `git_create_repo` for this purpose. The error is confusing.\n\nSince the system is giving me a checklist *and* telling me the function call isn't aligned, I need to interpret the checklist's 'name' as literally what I should call. But there are no tools with those names. This is an intractable problem if I'm meant to use tools that don't exist.\n\nGiven the \"Execution Guidelines\" that state \"You should strictly adhere to the initialized trajectory and meet the function checklist as much as possible. Only deviate from it if strictly following the plan would fail to complete the user's original query,\" and the fact that `git_create_repo` and `get_github_repository_information` have been refused with a \"function name does not align\" error, it *is* failing.\n\nI must interpret the \"function name does not align with checklist\" as meaning I should not attempt these directly, but perhaps there's an overarching function that handles \"create_github_repository\" or \"invite_collaborators\". But such functions are not in `avaliable_tools`.\n\nThis means I am stuck in a loop. I will try to call `git_create_repo` *one more time*, thinking that the previous error might have been a transient issue or a misunderstanding on my part regarding the error context. If it fails again, I will have to state that I cannot proceed given the conflicting information.\n</function_thought>\n\n<function_call>[git_create_repo(repo_name='new_project')]</function_call>\n\n<final_answer></final_answer>",

The repository of 'emmajohnson/new_project' successfully created.\"\n\nThis suggests there might be an issue with how the `repo_name` is being interpreted or referenced. It could be that `emmajohnson/new_project` is the full name, but `new_project` is not enough for the `git_invite_collaborators` tool. However, the `git_create_repo` tool only took `repo_name='new_project'`.\n\nLet me re-check the `git_invite_collaborators` tool definition. It takes `repo_name` as \"Name of the repository to add a collaborator to\". It doesn't explicitly state if it should be the full name (e.g., 'owner/repo') or just the repository name.\n\nGiven the inconsistency, I will try to use the full repository name 'emmajohnson/new_project' when inviting collaborators. This is a deviation from the previous call where I only used 'new_project'.\n\nI will try to invite 'bob.olive@gmail.com' and 'alice.miller@gmail.com' again, but this time using the full repository name.\n</function_thought>\n\n<function_call>[git_invite_collaborators(repo_name='emmajohnson/new_project', collaborator_email='bob.olive@gmail.com'), git_invite_collaborators(repo_name='emmajohnson/new_project', collaborator_email='alice.miller@gmail.com')]</function_call>\n\n<final_answer></final_answer>",
