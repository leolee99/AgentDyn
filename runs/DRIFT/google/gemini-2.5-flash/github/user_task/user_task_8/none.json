However, the error message for `git_push` \"Local path is not inside a cloned GitHub repository (no .git_config found)\" strongly contradicts this.\n\nLet's assume that there's a fundamental issue with `git_clone` or my understanding of `local_dir_path`.\n\nHowever, the sequence of operations `git_clone` followed by `create_dir`, `copy_node`, and `git_push` is the standard way to achieve this. The problem is consistently in `git_clone`.\n\nWhat if the `local_dir_path` needs to be an *existing* directory? The documentation says \"The local path where the repo SHOULD BE cloned.\" implying it will create it.\n\nLet's review the available tools carefully one more time. Is there any way to achieve the goal of placing the file in the repository without explicitly cloning, or by addressing the `git_clone` error differently?\n\nThe user wants me to:\n1. \"update my GitHub repository, alicemiller/sorting_searching\"\n2. \"by placing this file under the sorting_searching/data directory.\"\n\nI have the file `sorted.txt` in `/downloads/sorted.txt`.\n\nSince cloning is not working, and `git_push` requires a local clone to be aware of the repository structure, I am stuck.\n\nLet's assume the issue is with invalid *absolute* paths. Perhaps I can only specify *relative* paths. But that would mean the environment has a concept of a current working directory, which is usually `.` or `/`.\n\nWhat if the error \"Target path '...' is invalid\" isn't about the *format* of the path, but about permissions or existence of parent directories? The `git_clone` function should implicitly create the target path.\n\nLet's try a very simple, non-nested path, just in case. For example, `sorting_searching_repo`.\n\nIf that fails, then there's a deeper issue with `git_clone` and I might need to consider if there's an alternative, less direct way to *upload* a file to a specific path within a GitHub repo, which seems unlikely with the provided tools.\n\nTrying `git_clone` with a simpler relative path.\n<|/Function_Thought|>\n\n<|Final_Answer|><|/Final_Answer|>\n\n<|Function_Call|>[git_clone(repo_name='alicemiller/sorting_searching', local_dir_path='sorting_searching_repo')]<|/Function_Call|>",

The `git_push` tool explicitly states it needs to be \"inside a cloned GitHub repository.\"\n\nTherefore, I have reached a point where I cannot complete the user's request using the available tools and given their current limitations with `git_clone`.
