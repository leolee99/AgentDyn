Get a list of repositories owned by the current user.\n2. For each owned repository, check if it has been starred by other users.\n3. If it has been starred by other users, unstar the repository.\n\nHowever, the available tools do not allow me to directly check if a repository has been starred by *other users* or to list the users who have starred a repository. The `get_github_repository_information` tool can return the number of stars, but not who starred them. Also, there's no tool to specifically filter repositories owned by the current user.\n\nGiven the available tools, the closest I can get is to:\n1. Get the logged-in user's information, which includes their own starred repositories and the repositories they own.\n2. Unstar any repository that is on both lists (owned by me and starred by me). This doesn't directly address the \"also been starred by other users\" part, as I can't verify other users' stars.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the original query: \"For repositories owned by me, remove my stars if they have also been starred by other users.\"\n\nI can get the repositories I own and the repositories I have starred using `get_logged_in_github_user_information`.\nHowever, I cannot determine *if* they have also been starred by *other users*. The tool `get_github_repository_information` gives the total number of stars, but not the individual users who starred them.\n\nTherefore, I cannot fulfill the condition \"if they have also been starred by other users\".\n\nSince I cannot fulfill those conditions, I will inform the user about the limitations.\nThe trajectory plan was `get_logged_in_github_user_information`. Let's execute that first to see what information it provides, although I anticipate it won't give me the exact detail needed about *other* users' stars.\n<|/Function_Thought|>\n\n<|Final_Answer|><|/Final_Answer|>\n\n<|Function_Call|>[get_logged_in_github_user_information()]<|/Function_Call|>",
