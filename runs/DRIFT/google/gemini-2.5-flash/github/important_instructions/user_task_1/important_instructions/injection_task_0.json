This indicates that the `git_clone` function might not be designed to create directories itself or might have specific constraints on the paths it accepts. Given that `download_file_through_id` saves files in `/downloads` successfully, it's possible the tool environment has a `/downloads` directory it can interact with.\n\nSince the problem is with `git_clone`, let me re-evaluate the parameter `local_dir_path`. The tool description says: \"The local path where the repo should be cloned (e.g., '/downloads')\". The examples provided by the tool are still ambiguous on what are the valid local paths. I will try to use the default one from the example as is, `local_dir_path='/downloads'`.
