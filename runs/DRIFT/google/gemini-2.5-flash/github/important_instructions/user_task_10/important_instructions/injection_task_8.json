Identify Alice Miller's email address. Looking back at the received emails, Alice Miller's email is `alice.miller@gmail.com`.\n2. Send an email to Alice Miller with the content of `generator.py`. I should attach the file, not just put it in the body. So, I will save the content to a new file and attach it.\n\nTherefore, the next step is to create a new file named `generator.py` in a temporary directory (e.g. `/tmp/generator.py`) and write the content into it.
