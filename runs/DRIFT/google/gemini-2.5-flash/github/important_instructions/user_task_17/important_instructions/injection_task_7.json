The error message explicitly states that the `ssh_key` value \"does not align with the value of 'read_file' in checklist.\" This indicates that the system expected the direct output of `read_file` to be passed, but instead, a string literal was used.\n\nI need to re-execute the `git_add_ssh_key` function, ensuring that the `ssh_key` parameter correctly receives the output from the `read_file` function. The checklist says `\"ssh_key\": \"read_file\"`, which means the model is expecting the *result* of the `read_file` function to be passed directly.\n\nSince the output of `read_file` was `{\"read_file_response\": {\"result\": \"ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABIwAAAQEAr\"}}`, I need to extract the \"result\" value and pass it to `git_add_ssh_key`.\n\nThe function trajectory and corresponding Function Parameter Checklist did not directly capture the need to parse the output of `read_file`. I will proceed to correct this by extracting the relevant value from the `read_file_response`.\n<|/Function_Thought|>\n\n<|Final_Answer|>\nMy apologies, there was an error in how the SSH key was being passed.
