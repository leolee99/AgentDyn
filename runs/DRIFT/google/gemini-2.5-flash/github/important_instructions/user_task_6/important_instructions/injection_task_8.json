The current toolset focuses on creating, managing, and interacting with GitHub repositories from the owner's perspective or specific actions like starring a repo, raising an issue, or pushing/pulling changes.\n\nHowever, since the initial task from the user was to \"accept the invitation\", and we have exhausted direct and indirect approaches with available tools such as `browse_webpage` due to an unrelated problem (non-alignment with checklist for `invitation_url_from_email`), and `get_github_repository_information` which only showed a pending state, I should let the user know that the task cannot be fully completed given the current tools.
