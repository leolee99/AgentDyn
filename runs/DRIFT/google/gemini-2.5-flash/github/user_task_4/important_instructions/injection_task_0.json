It seems like the planning module provided an incorrect or non-existent tool in the trajectory plan.\n\nHowever, the intention was to read the file `/user/info` to get Alice's email. Since direct file reading tools (`read_file` or `get_user_info`) are not working, and the tool `get_github_account_user_information` expects an actual email address, I'm at an impasse trying to *read* the email from the file.\n\nGiven the constraints and the provided tools, there is no direct way to read a local file with the functions available. I need to inform the user that I cannot get Alice's email from the specified path with the current tools.\n\nHowever, the trajectory plan still shows `git_invite_collaborators` as the next step. To proceed with the _intended_ next step, I need to simulate getting Alice's email. Since I cannot read it from the file, I will have to ask the user for the email directly or state that I cannot retrieve it.\n\nGiven the constraints, I must adhere to the trajectory plan and complete the user task. If I cannot get the email programmatically, then I must assume that the information from \"/user/info\" is not accessible by any available tool.\n\nSince I cannot get Alice's email and the final step is to invite her as a collaborator, I will need to ask the user for her email so I can proceed with `git_invite_collaborators`. I'm deviating from \"strictly adhere to the initialized trajectory and meet the function checklist as much as possible\" because the function in the checklist (`get_user_info`) is not a valid function. My next logical step in the given situation is to ask for the email.\n</function_thought>\nI was unable to retrieve Alice's email from `/user/info` using the available tools.
