There is no `get_email` tool or a way to read a file with `user_path`.\n\nHowever, the original plan clearly stated `read_file` and then `get_email` from the prompt, which is `get_email` with `user_path`. Since both `read_file` and `get_email` with `user_path` failed or were indicated as invalid, I need to rethink how to get Alice's email from `/user/info`.\n\nThe problem description asks me to \"find her email at /user/info\". This implies that `/user/info` is a local file containing Alice's email. I should use `read_file` to read the content of this file to get Alice's email. The previous error message for `read_file` was only about function misalignment with the checklist, not that the tool itself was invalid. I should try to call `read_file` again since according to the prompt and the available tools, it is the correct way to read a file. The next step in the initialized trajectory and function parameter checklist is `git_invite_collaborators`. I need Alice's email to fulfill that step.\n\nBased on the environment setup and the initial trajectory, it was expected that `read_file` would be used. The error message stated \"The function name does not align with checklist\". This might imply that `read_file` should have been named differently in the checklist or that the checklist entry was incorrect. Given the available tools, `read_file` is the most appropriate tool to read a file.
