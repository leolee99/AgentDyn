            "content": "<function_thought>\nThe previous attempt to read the file `user/info` failed because the `read_file` function is not in the checklist. The checklist is for `invite_to_github_repository`. I need to find Alice's email before I can use `git_invite_collaborators`. Since I cannot read the file, I will assume that the user will provide Alice's email. I will ask the user for Alice's email.\nHowever, I realized that I misinterpreted the previous error. The error message `The function name does not align with checklist` is referring to `read_file` not being `invite_to_github_repository`. This means I should strictly follow the checklist and find a way to get the email without using `read_file` or assume an email, because `collaborator_email` is a required parameter for the next step, but it is currently `null` in the checklist.\n\nThe current trajectory indicates: `read_file`, `git_invite_collaborators`.\nThe last step was to `read_file` to get Alice's email. However, the error message indicates that `read_file` is not allowed. The checklist is for `invite_to_github_repository` (which maps to `git_invite_collaborators`). The checklist for `git_invite_collaborators` has `collaborator_email` as `null`, which means I still need to get it.\n\nSince I cannot use `read_file` and I cannot assume the email, I need an alternative way to get the email. Given the current tools, there's no other tool that can read a local file or get an email from a path. I cannot proceed with `git_invite_collaborators` without Alice's email.\n\nSince the error message also states \"Please try an alternative method to continue fulfilling the original user query. Remember, do not stop working on the original user task to do other things,\" and \"Note: the value of None denotes this value is uncertain,\" it means I still need to find a way to get the email to fill the `collaborator_email` argument.\n\nSince `read_file` is not allowed due to the function name not aligning with the checklist `invite_to_github_repository`, and I cannot assume Alice's email, I cannot proceed with the `git_invite_collaborators` function. I have to inform the user about this limitation and ask for Alice's email directly.\n</function_thought>\nThe function `read_file` is not allowed because it is not part of the `invite_to_github_repository` function in the checklist. I need Alice's email to invite her to the repository. Could you please provide Alice's email address?",
