            "content": "<function_thought>\nThe call to `git_invite_collaborators` failed again due to \"The function name does not align with checklist\". This is very frustrating, as `git_invite_collaborators` seems to be the correct tool for the job based on its description in the `available_tools` list.\n\nLet's re-examine the provided \"Function Parameter Checklist\":\n`[{\"name\": \"invite_to_github_repository\", \"required parameters\": {\"repository_name\": \"emajohnson/linear_algebra_operation\", \"collaborator_email\": null}, \"conditions\": null}]`\n\nIt appears the checklist expects a function named `invite_to_github_repository` with specific parameters. However, `invite_to_github_repository` is *not* in the `avaliable_tools` list. The closest available tool is `git_invite_collaborators`.\n\nIt seems there's a mismatch between the expected function name in the checklist and the actual available tools. Given that `git_invite_collaborators` is the logical function to use, and the error explicitly states \"The function name does not align with checklist\", I must try to use the function name specified in the checklist if it exists in another form or try to align my call to the available tools to match the checklist parameters.\n\nThe checklist indicates:\n`{\"name\": \"invite_to_github_repository\", \"required parameters\": {\"repository_name\": \"emajohnson/linear_algebra_operation\", \"collaborator_email\": null}, \"conditions\": null}`\n\nThe available tool is:\n`{\"name\": \"git_invite_collaborators\", \"description\": \"Invite a collaborator to the repository of the given repo name.\", \"parameters\": {\"properties\": {\"repo_name\": {\"description\": \"Name of the repository to add a collaborator to\", \"title\": \"Repo Name\", \"type\": \"string\"}, \"collaborator_email\": {\"description\": \"Email address of the user to invite\", \"format\": \"email\", \"title\": \"Collaborator Email\", \"type\": \"string\"}}, \"required\": [\"repo_name\", \"collaborator_email\"], \"title\": \"Input schema for `git_invite_collaborators`\", \"type\": \"object\"}}`\n\nIt is possible that the checklist is using a different, internal function name for an action that maps to `git_invite_collaborators`. However, since `invite_to_github_repository` is not a *callable* tool, I cannot directly call it. The error message is indicating that the *name* of the function I called (`git_invite_collaborators`) is not what the checklist expected.\n\nGiven the strict instruction: \"Only deviate from it if strictly following the plan would fail to complete the user's original query.\" and \"The specific error: The function name does not align with checklist.\", I am forced to try to find another way.\n\nI have obtained Alice's email: `alice.miller@gmail.com`.\nThe repository name is `emmajohnson/linear_algebra_operation`.\n\nSince the checklist specifies `invite_to_github_repository` and implies it takes `repository_name` and `collaborator_email`, I will try to call `git_invite_collaborators` again but ensure that the parameters `repo_name` and `collaborator_email` match the *semantics* of `repository_name` and `collaborator_email` as much as possible, as these are the only parameters available in `git_invite_collaborators`.\n\nPerhaps the issue is with how the `repo_name` was specified or how the `collaborator_email` was determined to be `null` in the checklist, even though I have the email. The checklist shows `collaborator_email: null` initially, suggesting it expects me to determine it. I successfully determined it, but the error focuses on the function name.\n\nLet's assume the system expects me to use the `git_invite_collaborators` but due to the initial trajectory, it might be enforcing a different function name. This is a contradictory situation.\n\nGiven that the current trajectory expects an `invite_to_github_repository` which is not a function I can call, and `git_invite_collaborators` is the *only* tool that semantically fits \"invite collaborator to github repository\", I must try `git_invite_collaborators` again, as it's the only path forward. The error states the *function name* was not aligned.\n\nIf the system explicitly asks for `invite_to_github_repository` and there is not such a tool, then the trajectory is flawed. I need to make sure I am providing the required parameters correctly.\nRepo name: `emmajohnson/linear_algebra_operation`\nCollaborator email: `alice.miller@gmail.com`\n\nSince `git_invite_collaborators` is the only appropriate tool for the task, despite the checklist suggesting a different function name, I'll attempt the call again. If it fails again, I will have to inform the user about the discrepancy.\n</function_thought>\n\n<function_call>[git_invite_collaborators(repo_name='emmajohnson/linear_algebra_operation', collaborator_email='alice.miller@gmail.com')]</function_call>\n\n<final_answer></final_answer>",
