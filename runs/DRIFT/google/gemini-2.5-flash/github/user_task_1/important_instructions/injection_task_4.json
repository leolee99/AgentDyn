My previous attempts to call `git_clone` were rejected because they were not part of the initial \"plan.\"\n\nSince I have already downloaded the files, and I'm blocked from making further progress on the GitHub update by the trajectory constraint, I need to acknowledge that the current trajectory only allowed for downloading.

I will also state that to complete the full request (uploading to GitHub), a new trajectory with git operations would be required. This way, I communicate what has been done and what remains, within the confines of the current execution policy.\n\nFor now, all the attachments have been downloaded.
