            "role": "assistant",
            "content": "<function_thought>\nThe previous attempt to create a repository failed because the function `git_create_repo` did not align with the checklist which specifies `create_repository`. The checklist also indicates a second step `copy_repository_contents`. Since `git_create_repo` is not a valid function name based on the checklist, and there's no direct `create_repository` tool, I need to find an alternative way to create the repository and then copy the contents.\n\nLooking at the available tools, the functions related to git operations are `git_create_repo`, `git_delete_repo`, `git_transfer_repo_ownership`, `git_clone`, `git_invite_collaborators`, `git_push`, `git_pull`, `git_issue`, `git_star`, `git_unstar`.\n\nThe checklist mentions `create_repository` and `copy_repository_contents`. It is possible that the `create_repository` is a conceptual high-level task rather than a direct tool call.\n\nGiven the initial goal is to create a new repository and make its contents the same as `bobolive/json_xml_parsing`, and the `git_create_repo` failed, I will try to use the `git_clone` tool to achieve the functionality of coping the contents, then rename the cloned directory to `new_project`.\n\nThe `git_clone` tool will clone `bobolive/json_xml_parsing`. I need to decide on a `local_dir_path`. I will clone it to a temporary directory first, then move it to \"new_project\". Since the checklist expects a `destination_repository` named \"new_project\", I should aim to have a local directory with that name.\n\nTherefore, the plan should be:\n1. Clone `bobolive/json_xml_parsing` to a temporary local directory.\n2. Rename/move the cloned directory to `new_project`.\n\nHowever, the checklist explicitly states `create_repository` with `name: new_project` as the first step and `copy_repository_contents` with `source_repository: bobolive/json_xml_parsing` and `destination_repository: new_project` as the second step. The `git_create_repo` was attempted and failed due \"function name does not align with checklist\". It seems the tool `git_create_repo` is indeed not the right tool for `create_repository`.\n\nLet's re-examine the available tools and the checklist. There is no `create_repository` function. There is `git_create_repo`. The error message is confusing, it states \"The function name does not align with checklist.\" while I'm trying to use `git_create_repo` which is an available tool. It is possible the checklist is using a different internal mapping or convention.\n\nGiven the error, I should assume that the direct `git_create_repo` is not the correct way to satisfy `create_repository` as outlined in the checklist.\n\nPerhaps the checklist expects me to achieve the \"create repository\" step by another means, or it's implicitly handled by the \"copy repository contents\" step if it implies cloning a repository directly into a *new* repository name.\n\nLet's consider the `copy_repository_contents` part of the checklist: `{\"name\": \"copy_repository_contents\", \"required parameters\": {\"source_repository\": \"bobolive/json_xml_parsing\", \"destination_repository\": \"new_project\"}, \"conditions\": null}`.\n\nIf I were to clone `bobolive/json_xml_parsing` locally, I would use `git_clone(repo_name='bobolive/json_xml_parsing', local_dir_path='/new_project')`. This would create a local directory named `new_project` containing the contents of `bobolive/json_xml_parsing`. This seems to align with the spirit of \"copy repository contents\" into \"new_project\".\n\nHowever, the prompt asks to create a *new repository* named `new_project`. Simply cloning to a local directory doesn't create a *remote* repository.\n\nThe checklist indicates two separate steps: \"create_repository\" and \"copy_repository_contents\". I have failed to satisfy `create_repository`.\nThe error message was \"The function name does not align with checklist.\" related to `git_create_repo`. This implies that `git_create_repo` is not the tool required by the trajectory.\n\nLet's consider if the `create_repository` intended in the checklist refers to a manual creation or a different tool function. Since I can't perform manual actions or use tools not in the list, I have to re-evaluate.\n\nWhat if the checklist item `{\"name\": \"create_repository\", ...}` is intended to be satisfied by `git_create_repo` but the system has a strict naming convention that it's checking against? This seems unlikely for a robust system.\n\nThe trajectory plan is `['git_create_repo', 'git_clone']`. The error states that `git_create_repo` for the `create_repository` item failed the checklist. This is contradictory with the trajectory.\n\nI will assume the trajectory plan is the source of truth for the tools to use, and I should try to resolve the checklist using these tools.\n\nThe error \"The function name does not align with checklist\" for `git_create_repo` when the trajectory *explicitly states* `git_create_repo` is very confusing.\n\nIf I cannot use `git_create_repo` for the 'create_repository' step, then the entire plan is broken.\n\nLet's assume the checklist is providing a *conceptual* sequence of operations and not necessarily direct tool calls. The `git_create_repo` tool exists and matches the user's intent to create a new repository. The error message is problematic.\n\nCould it be that the system is trying to match the *name* of the checklist item `create_repository` with the *function name* `git_create_repo` and failing directly on the string comparison? This would be a flaw in the system.\n\nGiven the strict adherence to the initialized trajectory, and the fact that `git_create_repo` is in the trajectory, I should attempt to call it again with the correct parameters specified in the checklist, and *hope* the error is transient or that I misread something.\n\nThe checklist for `create_repository` specifies `required parameters: {\"name\": \"new_project\"}`. My previous call was `git_create_repo(repo_name='new_project')`. The parameter names match.\n\nI must follow the initialized trajectory as strictly as possible. The trajectory is `['git_create_repo', 'git_clone']`. I have attempted `git_create_repo` and it failed due to \"function name does not align with checklist\". This is a critical point.\n\nIf `git_create_repo` is not \"create_repository\", what is? There is no tool called `create_repository`.\n\nCould the first item in the checklist `create_repository` be satisfied by something else?\n\nLet's re-evaluate the initial user prompt: \"Create a new repository named new_project and make sure its contents are the same as bobolive/json_xml_parsing.\"\n\nThe trajectory given is `['git_create_repo', 'git_clone']`.\nThe checklist is `[{\"name\": \"create_repository\", \"required parameters\": {\"name\": \"new_project\"}, \"conditions\": null}, {\"name\": \"copy_repository_contents\", \"required parameters\": {\"source_repository\": \"bobolive/json_xml_parsing\", \"destination_repository\": \"new_project\"}, \"conditions\": null}]`.\n\nThe previous error explicitly stated that the function name `git_create_repo` does not align with the checklist entry `create_repository`. This is very strict.\n\nIf I cannot use `git_create_repo` as `create_repository`, then I need to reconsider how to achieve the first step.\n\nPerhaps the \"create a new repository\" is implicitly handled by `copy_repository_contents` if that implies creating a new one on an external system, or perhaps I am supposed to create a local directory `new_project` first, and then clone into it if the system implies that \"repository\" refers to a local folder in some contexts.\n\nHowever, git repositories are usually remote.\nIf I can't use `git_create_repo`, and there's no `create_repository` tool, I might be stuck.\n\nWhat if the checklist is hinting at a different *tool* that *also* creates a repository, but a different one? No, the list of tools only has `git_create_repo`.\n\nI will try `git_clone` first, because if I can't create the repository, I can't proceed. If the error implies that \"create_repository\" is *not* `git_create_repo`, then I don't have a tool to satisfy the first checklist item directly as named.\n\nIf the goal is to make contents the same, and the error prevents `git_create_repo`, perhaps I should assume the agent needs to achieve the user's ultimate goal through available means, even if the strict mapping of checklist names to tool names fails. And to \"make its contents the same as bobolive/json_xml_parsing\", cloning the repository directly would be the most straightforward way to get the contents into a local directory first.\n\nIf `git_clone` creates a local directory with the contents, then I can call that local directory `new_project`. This would give me a local repository.\n\nThe user's request: \"Create a new repository named new_project and make sure its contents are the same as bobolive/json_xml_parsing.\"\nIf \"new_project\" is a remote repository, then `git_create_repo` is the tool.\nIf the error prevents `git_create_repo`, I have to satisfy the \"contents are the same\" part.\n\nI'm getting conflicting signals from the `trajectory_plan` vs. `function_checklist` and the error message.\nThe `trajectory_plan` clearly states `git_create_repo`.\nThe `function_checklist` says `create_repository`.\nThe error says `git_create_repo` does not align with `create_repository`.\n\nThis is a deadlock based on literal interpretation of the error.\n\nLet's assume the trajectoryplan is immutable and the error message is a heuristic check that failed but doesn't necessarily block execution of the plan's tools. The prompt states \"You should strictly adhere to the initialized trajectory and meet the function checklist as much as possible. Only deviate from it if strictly following the plan would fail to complete the user's original query.\"\n\nThe previous call `git_create_repo(repo_name='new_project')` resulted in an error `function name does not align with checklist`. This implies that the system is *preventing* me from using `git_create_repo` for the first checklist item.\n\nIf `git_create_repo` is disallowed, and the trajectory says to use it, this is a direct contradiction.\n\n\"Only deviate from it if strictly following the plan would fail to complete the user's original query.\"\nThe plan's first step, `git_create_repo`, has failed due to an alignment issue with the checklist. This means I cannot strictly follow the plan as it's being interpreted.\n\nTo complete the user's query (\"Create a new repository named new_project and make sure its contents are the same as bobolive/json_xml_parsing\"), I need to get the contents of `bobolive/json_xml_parsing` into something called `new_project`.\n\nThe second item of the checklist is `{\"name\": \"copy_repository_contents\", \"required parameters\": {\"source_repository\": \"bobolive/json_xml_parsing\", \"destination_repository\": \"new_project\"}, \"conditions\": null}`.\nThe `git_clone` tool can fulfill the `copy_repository_contents` conceptually.\n`git_clone(repo_name='bobolive/json_xml_parsing', local_dir_path='/new_project')` would create a local directory structure as `new_project` containing the contents.\n\nWhile this doesn't explicitly create a *remote* repository named `new_project`, it satisfies the content requirement. It might be interpreted that \"create a new repository named new_project\" could mean a local repository for the purpose of getting the contents right.\n\nIf the trajectory lists `git_create_repo` and `git_clone`, but `git_create_repo` is disallowed for the first checklist item, I might need to make a judgment call. The user wants the contents too.\n\nLet's assume that \"create a new repository\" as a remote operation is actually what the user intended, and my current tools + checklist is broken in communicating this.\n\nWhat if the checklist is giving me a hint that the *only* way to create the `new_project` is via copying contents into it, and there is no separate \"create empty repo\" step required by *the checklist*? But the user asked to \"create a new repository *named* new_project\", not \"create a local copy of bobolive/json_xml_parsing named new_project\".\n\nThis is a tough spot. I am strictly told to adhere to trajectory, but the first step failed.\nThe previous error is: \"The function name does not align with checklist.\"\n\nIf I try `git_clone` immediately after the error, I would be skipping `git_create_repo` from the trajectory.\nHowever, if `git_create_repo` *is not* what the checklist considers a \"create_repository\" operation, then I *must* deviate.\n\nConsider the user's intent more. \"Create a new repository named new_project\" (remote) AND \"make sure its contents are the same as bobolive/json_xml_parsing\" (remote content or local clone content).\n\nIf I literally clone `bobolive/json_xml_parsing` into `/new_project` using `git_clone`, I'm creating a local directory. This directory \"new_project\" will have the contents. The cloning itself creates the directory if it doesn't exist.\n\nLet's try to infer what `create_repository` from the checklist means. If it's not `git_create_repo`, what is it?\n\n\"Only deviate from it if strictly following the plan would fail to complete the user's original query.\"\nThe current plan, as interpreted by the system, fails at step 1.\n\nI will try to fulfill the \"copy repository contents\" part of the checklist next, as that implies getting the actual code from `bobolive/json_xml_parsing`. The `git_clone` tool is the most direct way to do this.\n\nThe `git_clone` tool requires a `repo_name` and an optional `local_dir_path`.\nThe `copy_repository_contents` checklist item has `source_repository: bobolive/json_xml_parsing` and `destination_repository: new_project`. This fits `git_clone`.\n\nSo the next logical step, given the failure to `create_repository` via `git_create_repo`, is to try to get the contents.\nI will use `git_clone` to clone the `bobolive/json_xml_parsing` repository.\nFor `local_dir_path`, I should use `/new_project` to adhere to the `destination_repository: new_project` in the checklist. This will create a local directory named `new_project` with the contents. While this doesn't explicitly create a *remote* github repository, it fulfills the content requirement into a named 'repository' locally.\n</function_thought>\n\n<function_call>[git_clone(repo_name='bobolive/json_xml_parsing', local_dir_path='/new_project')]</function_call>\n\n<final_answer></final_answer>",

This means that the system expects me to call a function literally named `create_repository` and `copy_repository_contents`, but no such tools exist in the provided `avaliable_tools` list.\n\nThis implies a severe mismatch between the *trajectory plan* (which lists actual callable tools like `git_create_repo` and `git_clone`) and the `Function Parameter Checklist` (which lists conceptual/generic function names like `create_repository` and `copy_repository_contents`).\n\nGiven that the explicit tools listed in the trajectory (`git_create_repo`, `git_clone`) are being rejected because their names don't match the *conceptual* checklist items, I am in a situation where I cannot proceed by directly calling the tools as intended by the trajectory or by trying to map them to the checklist. This is a complete breakdown of the provided execution guidance.\n\nThe prompt states: \"You should strictly adhere to the initialized trajectory and meet the function checklist as much as possible. Only deviate from it if strictly following the plan would fail to complete the user's original query.\"\n\nStrictly following the plan (`git_create_repo`, `git_clone`) *is failing* because the system says these function names do not align with the checklist.\n\nSince I cannot call `git_create_repo` nor `git_clone` because of this \"name alignment\" issue with the checklist, I must consider an alternative method to complete the user's query.\n\nThe user's query is: \"Create a new repository named new_project and make sure its contents are the same as bobolive/json_xml_parsing.\"\n\nSince direct git operations are being blocked by the internal checklist validation, I need to find another way to achieve the goal.\n\nLet's rethink:\n1. **Create a new repository named new_project**: This implies a *remote* repository on GitHub.\n2. **make sure its contents are the same as bobolive/json_xml_parsing**: This implies getting the content of `bobolive/json_xml_parsing` and putting it into `new_project`.\n\nGiven the impossibility of using `git_create_repo` and `git_clone` due to the naming issue with the checklist, I have no direct tools to create a remote repository and populate it from another remote repository.\n\nThe problem seems to be an internal configuration error where the system's *expectation* (checklist naming) does not match the *available tools* (actual tool names) or the *trajectory guidance*.\n\nSince both parts of the trajectory have failed due to the same reason, I cannot proceed with the planned trajectory.\n\nWhat else could \"make its contents the same\" mean if not cloning?\nThe `git_push` tool can push local content to a repository. If I can't clone, maybe I can download the files somehow, create them locally, and then push them?\n\nHowever, without being able to create the *remote* `new_project` repository (if `git_create_repo` is truly disallowed for the `create_repository` step), pushing doesn't make sense to a non-existent remote.\n\nThis is a scenario where the problem is with the provided instructions (trajectory and checklist) and the tool definitions, not necessarily my understanding of the intent.\n\nSince I am blocked by the system's internal validation, and I cannot *directly* achieve the goal using the `git_` tools specified in the trajectory due to the `CALL_ERROR`, I need to indicate this inability to the user or escalate it. However, the instructions say \"do not stop working on the original user task to do other things.\" This implies I should keep trying.\n\nThere are no other tools that conceptually achieve \"create a repository\" or \"copy contents of a repository\" among the available tools, other than the `git_create_repo` and `git_clone` that failed.\n\nGiven the strict adherence policy, and the specific `CALL_ERROR` that states \"function name does not align with checklist\", it means a literal string match is being performed.\n\nI cannot call `git_create_repo` or `git_clone` as this will result in the same precise error.\nThere are no other tools that can be interpreted to fulfill the checklist's `create_repository` or `copy_repository_contents` items.\n\nI must deviate from the explicit trajectory because it is failing due to internal system constraints (the mismatch between tool names and checklist names).\n\nIf I cannot create a new remote repository and copy contents, I cannot fulfill the request.\n\nI am forced to conclude that, given the current set of tools and the strict naming check of the checklist, the task is unfulfillable using the current toolset and validation rules. Since I cannot stop working on the original task, and I cannot perform the actions due to the error, I must communicate this.\nHowever, I cannot \"tell\" the user directly, according to the instructions. I must output a tool call.\n\nThis is a contradictory state. The system is preventing me from using the tools that match the *intent* and *trajectory*, because their *names* don't match the *checklist*.\n\nIf the task is truly impossible to perform with the available tools, I should indicate this using the `final_answer` if no more tools are needed. But the task is not yet complete.\n\nLet's assume there's a misunderstanding of what \"aligned with checklist\" means.\nIf the system *intended* for me to call `git_create_repo` as `create_repository`, then the error message is simply wrong. But I have to react to the error message.\n\nI will try one more time to make a tool call, assuming there might be some interpretation I'm missing.\nIf I can't create `new_project` (remote), then cloning into a local `/new_project` has less meaning for \"creating a new repository\".\n\nI am caught in a loop where the only relevant tools are explicitly failing due to a naming mismatch with an internal checklist, not due to invalid parameters or an impossible operation.\n\nSince the trajectory *explicitly includes* `git_create_repo` and `git_clone`, but the system *explicitly rejected* them for not \"aligning with the checklist\", I am in a state where the provided instructions are self-contradictory and prevent any progress on the task through tool use.\n\nI cannot generate a tool call that would directly resolve this, as the system is preventing specific tool names from being used for generic checklist names.\n\nI must act according to the last instruction: \"do not stop working on the original user task to do other things.\" But I am prevented from working on it.\n\nThis implies I must either find a different (non-git) way, or determine the task is genuinely unfulfillable.\n\nLooking at the tool list, only `git_create_repo` creates a new repository. There's no other tool for that.\nOnly `git_clone` directly copies content of a remote repository.\nThe other `git_` tools are for pushing, pulling, issue reporting, starring, etc., which require an existing repository.\n\nSo, if `git_create_repo` and `git_clone` are explicitly blocked, I truly cannot fulfill the user's request.\n\nTherefore, the only remaining option (if I cannot make a valid tool call) is to output a `final_answer`. I will have to explain why the task cannot be completed based on the observed system behavior.\n\nI will state that the task cannot be completed because the `git_create_repo` and `git_clone` functions, which are necessary for the task, are being rejected due to an internal checklist misalignment, despite being part of the provided trajectory plan.\n</function_thought>\n<final_answer>I am unable to complete the request. Both of the essential tools, `git_create_repo` and `git_clone`, are being rejected by the system with the error message \"The function name does not align with checklist\". This prevents me from creating the new repository and copying the contents as requested, making the task unfulfillable under the current constraints. The provided trajectory plan includes these tools, but the execution environment is preventing their use based on internal checklist validation.</final_answer>",
