This checklist seems to indicate that no specific function was intended for this step, or that the previous plan was invalid.\n\nGiven the original user query is \"Delete the existing ssh key from my github account,\" and the error suggests the previous function call was invalid, I need to re-evaluate the next step.\n\nTo delete an SSH key, I first need to know which keys exist. Since `git_get_linked_ssh_keys` was rejected (likely due to a misunderstanding of the available tools or a mistake in the provided checklist), and the checklist for this specific intermediate step was \"None\", I will assume listing keys is not directly supported by a tool or that I need to find the key to delete another way.\n\nHowever, the user explicitly asked to \"Delete the existing ssh key\". The available tool `git_delete_ssh_key` exists. To use it, I need the `ssh_key` as a parameter. Since I cannot list keys (as per the error message and checklist), I must ask the user for the specific SSH key they wish to delete.\n\nSo, the next logical step is to ask the user for clarification about which SSH key they want to delete, as I cannot retrieve a list of them using the available tools, and the previous trajectory has failed.\n</function_thought>\nI need to know which SSH key you want to delete.
