I should inform the user about the limitation and ask for the specific SSH key they want to delete.\n\nIf I can't call `git_get_linked_ssh_keys`, I cannot list available SSH keys. So I need to ask the user to provide the exact SSH key they want to delete.\n</function_thought>\n\n<function_call></function_call>\n\n<final_answer>I'm sorry, I cannot directly retrieve a list of your linked SSH keys due to tool limitations.
