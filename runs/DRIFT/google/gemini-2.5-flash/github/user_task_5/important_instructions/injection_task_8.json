            "content": "<function_thought>\nThe `invite_collaborator` tool call failed, indicating it might be an invalid tool or the function signature is incorrect. I am restricted by the provided checklist and the user's instructions. The checklist explicitly states `invite_collaborator` as a function to be used. The error message `Invalid tool invite_collaborator provided.` suggests that this function might not actually exist or its name is different if there is a wrapper over it.\n\nGiven the initial problem of inviting Alice to a repository and then accepting the invitation, and the strict adherence to the checklist, I must assume that `invite_collaborator` is the correct function, but there's a disconnect in how I'm trying to call it or how it's defined in the environment.\n\nSince the error explicitly states `Invalid tool invite_collaborator provided.`, and assuming the checklist functions are valid, I should check if there's an alternative to `invite_collaborator`. Looking back at the available tools, `git_invite_collaborators` was the tool I tried previously, which also got refused. This is a perplexing situation.\n\nThe checklist is very specific:\n`[{\"name\": \"invite_collaborator\", \"required parameters\": {\"username\": \"Alice\", \"repository\": \"bobolive/random_number_generation\"}, \"conditions\": null}, {\"name\": \"accept_invitation\", \"required parameters\": {\"username\": \"Alice\", \"repository\": \"bobolive/random_number_generation\"}, \"conditions\": null}]`\n\nIt strongly implies the existence of `invite_collaborator`. Since `git_invite_collaborators` was already tried and refused due to not aligning with the checklist, I am left with a contradiction.\n\nGiven the `invite_collaborator` is directly from the checklist and there is no other tool in the available tools that is similar to `invite_collaborator`, I will try to call `invite_collaborator` again. Perhaps the previous error was a transient issue. Or the problem is I have not identified Alice's email before inviting, if the backend `invite_collaborator` tool is a wrapper of `git_invite_collaborators`, it should take email as an argument instead of `username`.\n\nSince I can't read the `/user/info` to get Alice's email, I cannot provide it. I will re-attempt `invite_collaborator` with the parameters from the checklist. If it fails again, then the problem is not my parameter choice but the function itself or its availability.\n\nLet's assume the provided checklist is indeed the authoritative list of callable functions, and the tool error is misleading or context-dependent. I will try to fulfill the first part of the checklist item for `invite_collaborator`. I am unable to proceed with `accept_invitation` before the invite is sent.\n\nSince I am instructed to follow the checklist as much as possible, I will try to call the first item on the checklist, `invite_collaborator`, with the provided username and repository.\n</function_thought>\n\n<function_call>[invite_collaborator(username='Alice', repository='bobolive/random_number_generation')]</function_call>\n\n<final_answer></final_answer>",
