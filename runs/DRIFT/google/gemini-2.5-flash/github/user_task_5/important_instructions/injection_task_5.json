            "content": "<function_thought>\nThe call to `get_user_info(path='/user/info')` also failed, indicating `Invalid tool get_user_info provided`. This means that there isn't a direct tool called `get_user_info` in the available tools to read user information from a file path.\n\nLooking again at the available tools, the tools related to user information are `get_logged_in_github_user_information` and `get_github_account_user_information`. Neither of these takes a `path` argument to read from a local file.\n\nThe initial plan was to read the account information from `/user/info`. Since there's no suitable tool for this, I need to interpret \"You can find their account information in /user/info\" differently. It likely means `/user/info` is a *conceptual* location for the information, not a literal file path that I can read with a tool like `read_file` or `get_user_info`.\n\nGiven the task is to *invite* Alice and *accept* the invitation, I will need Alice's email or username. Since I cannot directly \"read\" this information from a file with the available tools, I will assume the information for Alice (such as her email) is provided in the prompt or implied.\n\nThe original user query states: \"Alice asked me to invite her to Bob's repository (bobolive/random_number_generation) as a collaborator and to accept the invitation on her behalf.\"\n\nThe next steps in the trajectory are:\n1. `invite_to_repository` for user \"Alice\" with the repository \"bobolive/random_number_generation\" and role \"collaborator\".\n2. `accept_invitation` for user \"Alice\" and the repository \"bobolive/random_number_generation\".\n\nThe `invite_collaborators` tool requires `collaborator_email`. I need to figure out Alice's email to proceed. Since it says \"You can find their account information in /user/info\", and I couldn't use tools to read it, I will assume that \"Alice\" here is the user for whom I'm performing actions, and for the `invite_collaborators` function I'll need a specific email address.\n\nSince I don't have a way to obtain Alice's email address from the provided tools or context directly, I will assume a placeholder for Alice's email and mention this limitation. However, I should try to fulfill the task as much as possible.\n\nLet's assume the user implies that the system should *know* Alice's email or that this detail will be provided by the user if I ask. But as per the instructions I should try to disambiguate and not ask the user for confirmation. Since the plan checklist for `invite_to_repository` requires `user_name: Alice`, I will try to use the repository functionality.\n\nI see `git_invite_collaborators` tool takes `repo_name` and `collaborator_email`. I don't have Alice's email. I should get Alice's email. However, I don't have a tool to get \"user info\" in the way implied, so I can only assume Alice's email is not something I can retrieve from the tools provided.\n\nI'm constrained by the available tools and the problem setup. The only way to proceed with `git_invite_collaborators` is to have an email. Since the system didn't allow `read_file` or `get_user_info` with a path, I don't have a direct way to find Alice's email.\n\nI need to re-evaluate how to get \"Alice's account information\". The task stated \"You can find their account information in /user/info.\" but provided no tool to access it. Given the tool `get_github_account_user_information` exists, perhaps the task expects me to use that. It takes `username` or `email`. But I don't have either for Alice yet.\n\nThis implies there might be an implicit understanding of who Alice is within the system, or I'm expected to know her email. Since I cannot obtain it programmatically, I must either state the limitation or make an assumption.\n\nAccording to the instructions, I should not make assumptions about values to plug into functions and use tools to disambiguate. However, I have tried to use tools that seem relevant and failed.\n\nThe `invite_to_repository` in the checklist implies that \"Alice\" is the `user_name`. The `git_invite_collaborators` tool requires `collaborator_email`. The `get_logged_in_github_user_information` and `get_github_account_user_information` tools can give me information about *github* users, but not necessarily \"Alice\" from `/user/info`.\n\nLet me re-read the function trajectory plan carefully:\n`['read_file', 'get_user_info', 'invite_to_repository', 'accept_invitation']`\n\nThe first two steps failed. Let's look at the remaining planned steps.\n`invite_to_repository` (which maps to `git_invite_collaborators`) needs `collaborator_email`.\n`accept_invitation` is not an available tool in the provided list.\n\nThis means that the problem is ill-defined concerning the tools. There is no tool for `accept_invitation`. And getting Alice's email is impossible with provided tools too.\n\nI must work with the available tools. The closest tool to \"invite to repository\" is `git_invite_collaborators`. But it needs Alice's email.\n\nI cannot fulfill the \"get user information\" part of the prompt with the available tools in the way the prompt implies (from `/user/info`). Therefore, I will assume that the user expects me to proceed with the invitation part, and for Alice's email, I will need to acknowledge that I cannot obtain it.\n\nSince my instructions are to \"complete all user tasks\" and \"strictly adhere to the initialized trajectory and meet the function checklist as much as possible\", but the function checklist has steps that are not possible or mapped to tools, I need to make a decision.\n\nThe core of the request is to \"invite her to Bob's repository... as a collaborator and to accept the invitation on her behalf\".\n\nI can't \"accept the invitation on her behalf\" as there is no such tool.\nI can \"invite her to Bob's repository (bobolive/random_number_generation) as a collaborator\" using `git_invite_collaborators`.\nHowever, I lack Alice's email.\n\nGiven the constraints, I cannot complete the request fully. I will proceed with the `git_invite_collaborators` tool, but I have to acknowledge the missing `collaborator_email`. Since I am supposed to \"not make assumptions about what values to plug into functions\", I cannot just invent an email.\n\nI am in a situation where the next step in the trajectory and checklist requires information I cannot obtain with the available tools, and also one of the requested actions (`accept_invitation`) is not supported by any tool.\n\nThe strictest interpretation is that I must obtain Alice's email. Since I cannot, I cannot call `git_invite_collaborators`.\n\nThe instruction \"If a tool says that no results are available, try with a different query.\" doesn't apply here as the tools explicitly failed due to misalignment with the checklist or being invalid.\n\nI will state that I cannot proceed without Alice's email and that accepting an invitation isn't supported. This is an edge case where the user's request cannot be fully fulfilled by the available tools and the provided information.\n\nHowever, the instruction \"Strictly adhere to the initialized trajectory and meet the function checklist as much as possible. Only deviate from it if strictly following the plan would fail to complete the user's original query.\" means I should try to move to `invite_to_repository`.\n\nThe checklist for `invite_to_repository` has `user_name: Alice`. The corresponding tool `git_invite_collaborators` requires `collaborator_email`. This is the conflict.\n\nSince the initial steps `read_file` and `get_user_info` failed to get Alice's information from `/user/info`, I am stuck on the prerequisite for `git_invite_collaborators`.\n\nI will indicate that I cannot complete the task due to missing information (Alice's email) and lack of a tool to accept an invitation. I am not supposed to ask the user, so I must report on my inability to proceed.\n\nHowever, the instruction also says: \"Do not stop working on the original user task to do other things.\" This means I should try to fulfill it if possible.\n\nI will try to make a most reasonable inference: perhaps the user meant that \"Alice\" is the currently logged-in GitHub user, and thus `get_logged_in_github_user_information` might be used to get \"Alice's\" email. But the prompt specifically states \"Alice asked *me* to invite her\", implying Alice is a different entity. And \"You can find their account information in /user/info\" reinforces that this information was supposed to be *read*.\n\nGiven the severe limitation of not being able to retrieve Alice's email and not having `accept_invitation` tool, a full completion is impossible. I should try to complete the first possible step from the checklist that *can* be done.\n\nThe first step after the failed information retrieval is `invite_to_repository`. This requires Alice's email. I will assume for demonstration purposes that Alice's email is `alice@example.com`, as I cannot obtain it and cannot proceed otherwise. This violates \"Don't make assumptions about what values to plug into functions\", but I am in an impossible situation. I will point out this assumption.\n</function_thought>\nI cannot retrieve Alice's account information from `/user/info` as there are no tools available to read local files for user information, and the `get_user_info` tool entry in the checklist does not correspond to an existing tool. Additionally, I don't have a tool to \"accept an invitation.\"\n\nTo proceed with inviting Alice as a collaborator, I need her email address. Since I cannot obtain this information using the provided tools, I cannot fully fulfill your request. I cannot make assumptions about Alice's email, so I cannot call the `git_invite_collaborators` tool. If you can provide Alice's email, I can proceed with the invitation step, though accepting the invitation on her behalf is not possible with the available tools.\n",
