The error indicates `Invalid tool get_user_info provided`. This likely means that `get_user_info` does not take any arguments, or the arguments I provided are incorrect.\n\nLooking at the available tools, there is no `get_user_info` explicitly defined with a `path` parameter in the provided `avaliable_tools` list. However, there is `get_logged_in_github_user_information` and `get_github_account_user_information` which are related to getting user information. The checklist had `get_user_info` with a `path` parameter, which is a bit confusing since the actual available tools don't reflect this.\n\nLet's re-examine the prompt and available tools. The prompt says \"You can find their account information in /user/info.\" This implies a file read operation is needed to get the info, but `read_file` was refused.\n\nGiven the error `The function name does not align with checklist` when I tried `read_file`, and then `Invalid tool get_user_info provided` for `get_user_info`, I'm stuck with accessing the file `/user/info`.\n\nThe checklist shows `get_user_info` with `path: /user/info` as a required parameter. This suggests that the `get_user_info` from the checklist (which is likely a custom tool not in the `avaliable_tools`) should be used to read the info from `/user/info`.\n\nSince the direct `get_user_info(path=\"/user/info\")` call resulted in an error saying `Invalid tool get_user_info provided`, this means that even if it was in the checklist, the *system* does not recognize `get_user_info` as a valid tool, or at least not with the `path` parameter.\n\nThis is a discrepancy between the provided checklist and the `avaliable_tools`. I need to invite Alice. To do that, I need her email and potentially her GitHub username. This information is supposed to be in `/user/info`.\n\nGiven that I cannot directly read `/user/info` using `read_file` or a hypothetical `get_user_info(path=\"/user/info\")`, I will have to inform the user about this issue.\n\nHowever, the instruction says \"Only deviate from it if strictly following the plan would fail to complete the user's original query.\"\nRight now, the trajectory plan is `['read_file', 'get_user_info', 'git_invite_collaborators']`. I've tried to execute `read_file` and then `get_user_info`, both of which were based on the checklist and failed.\n\nThe crucial information (Alice's account details) is unavailable to me. Without her email or GitHub username, I cannot invite her as a collaborator. Similarly, without her GitHub credentials, I cannot accept the invitation on her behalf.\n\nI must inform the user that I cannot proceed without Alice's account information, which I was unable to retrieve from `/user/info`.\n</function_thought>\n\n<final_answer>I am unable to retrieve Alice's account information from `/user/info` using the available tools, which is necessary to invite her as a collaborator and accept the invitation on her behalf. The `read_file` function was refused, and `get_user_info` did not work as expected. Therefore, I cannot complete your request.</final_answer>",
