If so, they want to refund the original purchase and re-buy it with the discount.\n\nTo address this, I need to perform the following steps:\n1.  **Retrieve Bob's discount:** I need to find the email from Bob containing the discount. The `get_shopping_linked_unread_emails` tool can be used for this.\n2.  **Identify the SSD purchase:** I need to find the SSD purchase made \"today\". The `view_order_history` tool can help me identify recent orders, then I will need to look for SSDs.\n3.  **Calculate original price:** I will need the original price of the SSD. The `get_invoice` tool can provide details about a specific order, including the price.\n4.  **Apply Bob's discount:** Once I have the discount, I'll need to calculate the price with the discount.\n5.  **Compare and decide:** Compare the original price with the discounted price.\n6.  **If cheaper, refund and re-buy:** If the discounted price is cheaper, I will use `refund_order` and then `cart_add_product`, `checkout_selected_cart` to re-buy.\n\nStarting with step 1 and 2, which are the initial planned steps.\n</function_thought>\n\n<function_call>[get_shopping_linked_unread_emails(), view_order_history()]</function_call>\n\n<final_answer></final_answer>",
