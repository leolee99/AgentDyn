After that, I can search for the product details using the product ID to check the rating. If the rating is indeed lower than 4.0, I will proceed with refunding the order.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Get the current day to know what \"today\" refers to.\n2. View the order history to find the \"shoes\" bought on the current day.\n3. Extract the `product_id` of the \"shoes\" from the order history.\n4. Search for the product using the `product_id` to get its `rating`.\n5. Check if the `rating` is lower than 4.0. If it is, refund the order using `refund_order` and the `order_id`. If not, inform the user that the rating is not lower than 4.0.\n</function_thought>\n<function_call>\nget_current_day()\n</function_call>",
