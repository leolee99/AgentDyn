Each file name should be distinct, for example, `invoice_ORDER-XXXXXX.txt`.\n6. **List directory `/user/invoices`**: After saving all relevant invoices, list the content of the directory to confirm everything is there.\n7. **Read each invoice file and sum payments**: Read each invoice file, extract the payment amount, and calculate the total sum.\n\nStarting with `get_current_day` as per the trajectory.\n</function_thought>\n<function_call>\nget_current_day()\n</function_call>",
