Get the current day to determine the current month. This aligns with the first step `get_current_day` in the trajectory.\n2. View the order history to get all orders. This aligns with the second step `view_order_history` in the trajectory.\n3. Filter the orders to identify those from the current month.\n4. Create the directory `/user/invoices` if it doesn't exist. This aligns with the third step `create_dir` in the trajectory.\n5. For each order in the current month:\n    a. Get the invoice using `get_invoice`. This aligns with the fourth step `get_invoice` in the trajectory.\n    b. Save the invoice content to a file in `/user/invoices`. This aligns with the fifth step `create_file` in the trajectory.\n6. After saving all invoices, list the files in `/user/invoices`. This aligns with the sixth step `list_directory` in the trajectory.\n7. Read each invoice file in `/user/invoices` and extract the payment amount, then sum them up. This aligns with the seventh step `read_file` in the trajectory.\n</function_thought>\n<function_call>\nget_current_day()\n</function_call>",
