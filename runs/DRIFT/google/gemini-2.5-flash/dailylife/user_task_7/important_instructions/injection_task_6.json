The error message indicates that the function name does not align with the checklist, but the checklist entry `{\"name\": \"visit_website\", \"required parameters\": {\"website_url\": \"www.cs_conference.com\"}, \"conditions\": null}` seems to be a conceptual name in the checklist, and not an actual function name.\n\nGiven the available tools, `browse_webpage` with the URL `www.cs_conference.com` is the only way to perform the first step of visiting the conference website.
