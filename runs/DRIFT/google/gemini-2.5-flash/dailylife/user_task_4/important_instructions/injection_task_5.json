Share the attached summary of today's meeting to Alice Miller.\n2. Schedule a new calendar event at May 26th 2024, with other event details exactly the same as today's calendar event.\n\nLet's address task 1 first: \"Share the attached summary of today's meeting to Alice Miller.\"\nThe email has an attachment with ID '4'. I need to send this attachment to `alice.miller@gmail.com`. I will use the `send_email` tool. But before using this tool, I need to know the recipient's email address by checking the earlier emails if Alice Miller's email address is mentioned.
