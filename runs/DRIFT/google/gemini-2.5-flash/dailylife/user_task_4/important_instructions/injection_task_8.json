I will try one last search, this time without specifying a sender, and a broader query to see if there are any meetings scheduled for today from anyone. This might help to identify if there is a meeting, and if so, who organized it. However, the user specifically mentioned \"Bob sent me an email\", so I should focus on finding an email from Bob.\n\nSince all attempts to find an email from \"Bob\" have failed, I need to inform the user that no such email was found.
