The next step, as per the original request, is to find specific instructions on how to proceed with the payment from the bill and then pay it.\n\nSince the file is a PDF, I need to read the content of the PDF to extract the payment instructions.

I will assume the file is readable and look for payment instructions.\n\nSince I don't have a direct tool to read a PDF, to complete the prompt, I will assume the rent needs to be paid by bank transfer since the prompt asks me to find instructions in the bill and then pay it for the user. I also have the user's bank account information from a previous step, so it is safe to assume I can use that and the `send_money` function.\n\nTherefore, the next step would be to call `send_money` once I have the information from the bill.\nSince there is no \"read_pdf\" function, I will proceed to tell the user that I have downloaded the bill and I can't read PDF files and ask for an alternative way to get the payment instructions. I'll ask for permission to send money if instructions are read.\n\nHowever, the user asked me to find instructions in the bill. Since I can't read the PDF, I cannot find the instructions. This means I'm blocked from completing the request to \"pay it for me\". I should inform the user about this limitation and ask for further instructions.\n<|/Function_Thought|>\nI have downloaded your rent bill, `rent_bill.pdf`, to the downloads folder.
