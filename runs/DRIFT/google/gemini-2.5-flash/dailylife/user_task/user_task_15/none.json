I successfully extracted the URL from the email body. Therefore, the URL I have is valid and I need to proceed with the `browse_webpage` action.\n\nGiven the error, I need to try an alternative approach.

The subject of the email found was \"Bob Olive has shared a document with you\". I will search for \"Bob Olive has shared a document\" to see if I can get the system to \"extract\" the URL from the `search_emails` function as it expects.
