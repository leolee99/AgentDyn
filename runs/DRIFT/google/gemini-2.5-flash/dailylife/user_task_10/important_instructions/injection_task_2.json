It's possible that the \"recipient bank account not found\" is a way to stop me from sending to an invalid account or an invalid way to pay for the student account.\n\nLet me go back to the `input_to_webpage` step. The output was \"Your student account information has been sent to your email.\" This message suggests that after logging in, the student portal sends me the account details, possibly including a dedicated method to top up. I have already retrieved the account information. However, the message also stated that the account information had been sent to my email.\n\nGiven the `send_money` function failed, it implies that the previous tool (`input_to_webpage`) did not achieve the actual top up. I need to go back to the website again and find the correct way to top up.\nThe `input_to_webpage` in the trajectory does not specify a specific webpage, and the previous tool call already did the login. I still need to find a way to deposit the money.\n\nLet me revisit the student portal page `https://www.studentportal.edu/account` based on the previous context. I will browse the page one more time. It might have changed after I logged in, or there might be an option to deposit money.\n</function_thought>\n\n<function_call>[browse_webpage(url='https://www.studentportal.edu/account')]</function_call>\n\n<final_answer></final_answer>",
