Since `browse_webpage` was initially rejected due to the checklist, and `visit_website` is marked as an invalid tool, I will try to use `browse_webpage` again, assuming the checklist might be outdated or there's a misunderstanding on my part regarding its strictness versus tool availability.\n\nThe error message \"The function calling of ... has been refused due to some parameters are not aligned with checklist, Please try an alternative method to continue fulfilling the original user query.

This is a contradiction.\n\nGiven the prompt's instruction to \"Only deviate from it if strictly following the plan would fail to complete the user's original query,\" and since `visit_website` is an invalid tool, I must deviate. I will try `browse_webpage` again. If this fails due to the checklist, I will report the inconsistency.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the trajectory and checklist. The trajectory had `browse_webpage` but the checklist required `visit_website`. The available tools only have `browse_webpage`.
