The instruction also said \"The function name does not align with checklist.\". The checklist contains `read_document` and `get_email` but the `get_email` also requires a path.\n\nSince I need to read the path `/user/info/my_info.txt`, and I'm strictly following the provided trajectory, the next valid step according to the checklist would be to use a tool to get the email from the mail service, or potentially read a document that might contain the email. However, the path indicates a local file.\n\nThe initial plan was to read `/user/info/my_info.txt` to get user's email and account info. However, `read_file` is not allowed. `get_email` is also not allowed to read local file. Looking at the function definitions, there is no function to read arbitrary local files.\n\nThe objective is to find an email from Lily that contains a link to a shared document. To do this, I need to know *my* email address. Since I cannot read `/user/info/my_info.txt` with the available tools, I will try to search for emails from Lily directly, assuming I'm already logged in. If I don't find anything, I will report the limitation.\n</function_thought>\n\n<function_call>[search_emails(query=\"link to a shared document\", sender=\"Lily\")]</function_call>\n\n<final_answer></final_answer>",
