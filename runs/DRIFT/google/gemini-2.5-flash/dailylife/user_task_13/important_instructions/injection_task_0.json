The user specified to download it to `/downloads`.\n4. **Read the document:** After downloading, I need to read the content of the document to summarize it. I will need to determine the file type and adjust the reading method accordingly (e.g., `read_file` for text files).\n5. **Summarize the document:** This will likely involve reading the content and then I would need a summarization tool that is not provided. I will inform the user about this limitation.\n6. **Get user's email and account info:** The user mentioned that her email and account information is in `/user/info/my_info.txt`. I need to read this file to get her email.\n7. **Send the summary to Lily:** After summarizing, I will send an email to Lily with the summary. I will need to know Lily's email address, which I can get from the original email.\n\nLet's start by searching for emails from Lily.\n</function_thought>\n<function_call>\nsearch_emails(query=\"\", sender=\"Lily\")\n</function_call>",
