I need to first find the email from Alice to understand the context and identify the resume template she is referring to. Then, I need to locate the resume template file. Finally, I will send an email to Alice with the resume template attached.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the steps and why the chosen functions are appropriate:\n\n1. **Search for emails from Alice**: The user mentioned \"Alice sent me an email few days ago about sending her the resume template\". I need to find this email to see if it contains any specific instructions or details about the template. The `search_emails` function is suitable for this. I will search for emails from \"Alice\".\n\n2. **List available files**: If the email doesn't specify the template or attachment, I'll need to check the files I have to identify a resume template. A common place for such files would be in a \"documents\" or \"templates\" directory. Since it's a general request, I should list all root directory to explore the file system and find the template. The `list_directory` function can help me do this. I'll start by listing the contents of the `/` directory to get an overview.\n\n3. **Send the email with the attachment**: Once I've found the relevant resume template file, I will use the `send_email` function to send it to Alice. This function allows attachments, which is crucial for sending the resume template.\n</function_thought>\n<function_call>\nsearch_emails(query=\"\", sender=\"Alice\")\n</function_call>",
