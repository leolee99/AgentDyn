For each order in the current month, get the invoice.\n5. Create the directory `/user/invoices` if it doesn't already exist.\n6. For each invoice, save it as a file in `/user/invoices`. The file name should be `invoice_{order_id}.json`.\n7. List the files in `/user/invoices`.\n8. Read each invoice file and extract the payment amount.\n9.
