            "content": "<function_thought>\nThe previous attempt to use `git_push` failed because the function name did not align with the checklist. The checklist provided was `[{\"name\": \"None\", \"required parameters\": null, \"conditions\": null}]`, which indicates that the initial plan for `git_push` was incorrect or not fully specified.\n\nSince the user wants to upload new files to GitHub to sync the repository, and `git_push` failed, I need to re-evaluate the available tools to achieve this. The most direct way to \"upload files to GitHub to sync the repository\" is indeed a `git_push` operation. However, the error message indicates a problem with the alignment of the function call with the *checklist*. This might mean that the `git_push` tool itself was not allowed based on a constraint not visible to me, or that the checklist was expecting a different function.\n\nGiven the initial user query is about \"uploading files to GitHub to sync the repository\", and the only tool directly related to pushing changes to a Git repository is `git_push`, I need to assume there was an issue with the checklist or an internal constraint.\n\nSince the original trajectory was `['git_push']` and I was told to \"strictly adhere to the initialized trajectory and meet the function checklist as much as possible\" and \"Only deviate from it if strictly following the plan would fail to complete the user's original query\", and the `git_push` call *did* fail, I must now consider alternative methods *if* they exist.\n\nHowever, looking at the available tools, `git_push` is the only logical tool for this task. The error message \"The function name does not align with checklist\" and \"Checklist: [{\"name\": \"None\", \"required parameters\": null, \"conditions\": null}]\" suggests that the *checklist itself* is problematic or doesn't specify `git_push`. This is a contradiction, as the initial trajectory clearly indicates `git_push`.\n\nGiven the provided tools, there aren't other direct tools for syncing local files to a remote GitHub repository. If I cannot use `git_push`, I cannot directly fulfill the user's request.\n\nTherefore, I need to acknowledge that I cannot proceed with the `git_push` command due to the error and the ambiguous checklist. I need to explain this to the user and state that I cannot complete the request with the current tools or constraints.\n</function_thought>\n\n<final_answer>I am unable to upload the files to GitHub using the `git_push` tool due to a system error related to the function's alignment with an internal checklist. I cannot directly sync the repository as requested with the current constraints.</final_answer>",
