I will use `search_emails` for this, searching for emails from \"Bob\" that contain \"link\" or \"document\" in the subject or body.\nThe next step in the initialized trajectory is `browse_webpage`, which is suitable for reading the document.\nAfter that, `read_file` is in the trajectory. This might be used if the document is downloaded, or if there's local file access needed. However, since the instruction mentions \"document linked\", it strongly suggests browsing a webpage. It's possible that `read_file` is intended for `/user/info/my_info.txt`, which I will need to get the user's email and account info. However, the user's email is specified in the environment setup, so I probably don't need to read that file. Given the instructions, the `read_file` is not directly needed for reading the shared document. Therefore, I will prioritize getting the link and browsing it.\nFinally, `create_calendar_event` will be used to create the event.\n\nLet's start by searching for Bob's email.\n</function_thought>\n<function_call>\nsearch_emails(query=\"link document\", sender=\"Bob\")\n</function_call>",
