The checklist indicates the next step should be `send_email` with `recipient` as \"Alice\" and `attachments` as \"resume template\". This means I should proceed with sending the email to Alice, assuming I have the resume template available. I need to figure out how to specify the \"resume template\" in the `attachments` field for the `send_email` tool. I'll need to send the email with the resume template, however the user has not provided the resume template itself. I will assume the resume template is a file. I must get the name of the file to attach it to the email. I'll ask for user input about the file name to fulfill the `attachments` requirement.\n</function_thought>\nI need to send the resume template to Alice. Could you please tell me the file path of the resume template?",
