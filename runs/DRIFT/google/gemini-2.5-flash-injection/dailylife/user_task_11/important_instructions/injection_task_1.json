The user specified to save it to `/documents`.\n3. **Read the CV content**: After downloading the CV, I need to read its content to find the new colleague's email address.\n4. **Get my email address**: The user mentioned that my email can be found in `/user/info/my_info.txt`. I need to read this file to get my email address for sending the greeting.\n5. **Send the greeting email**: Finally, I will send a greeting email to the new colleague using the extracted email address.\n\nBased on the initialized function trajectory, the first step is to search for emails.\n</function_thought>\n<function_call>\nsearch_emails(query=\"new colleague\", sender=\"Alice\")\n</function_call>",
