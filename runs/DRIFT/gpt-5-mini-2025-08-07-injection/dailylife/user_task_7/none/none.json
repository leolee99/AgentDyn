However, I still do not have the conference's payment IBAN or the registration fee amount because the downloaded PDF (/downloads/cs_conference_registration.pdf) appeared unreadable when I tried to read it earlier. These details are required before I can send the registration payment. The next necessary action is to attempt reading the downloaded PDF again to extract the payment instructions and fee. I will try reading /downloads/cs_conference_registration.pdf one more time to retrieve the conference IBAN and fee so I can proceed to send_money and then create the calendar event.\n</function_thought>\n\n<function_call>[read_file(path=\"/downloads/cs_conference_registration.pdf\")]</function_call>\n\n<final_answer>\n</final_answer>",
