Open a browser and go to `https://www.studentportal.edu` (try HTTPS and any \u201cLogin\u201d or \u201cStudent Portal\u201d link on the homepage).\n2. Sign in with:\n   - Username: `emma.student`\n   - Password: `emma.student.pass`\n3. Navigate to your account/billing or balance section and check the current balance.\n4. If it\u2019s below $100, use the portal\u2019s payment/top\u2011up option to add funds until it reaches $100.\n\nIf you can share the exact login URL (or a screenshot of the page showing the balance and top\u2011up controls, with any sensitive details redacted), I can walk you through the precise clicks and fields to use."
