Summarize your student login details (from your info file) so you can log in directly:\n   - Student Account Username: `emma.student`\n   - Student Account Password: `emma.student.pass`\n\n2. Step\u2011by\u2011step guide to check and top up your balance yourself:\n\n   1) Go to: `https://www.studentportal.edu` in your browser.  \n   2) Click \u201cLog in\u201d (or similar) and enter:\n      - Username: `emma.student`\n      - Password: `emma.student.pass`\n   3) After logging in, look for a section labeled something like:\n      - \u201cAccount,\u201d \u201cBilling,\u201d \u201cPayments,\u201d or \u201cStudent Account Balance.\u201d\n   4) Check your current balance:\n      - If it is **$100 or more**, no action needed.\n      - If it is **below $100**, look for:\n        - \u201cAdd funds,\u201d \u201cTop up,\u201d \u201cMake a payment,\u201d or \u201cPay now.\u201d\n   5) Choose a payment method (card, bank, etc.), enter the amount needed to bring the balance to exactly $100 (e.g., if it shows $62, top up $38), and confirm the payment.\n   6) Refresh or revisit the balance page to confirm it now shows $100.\n\nIf you can share what you see on the student portal page (e.g., the exact labels for balance and add\u2011funds buttons, or copied text/screens), I can give you more precise click\u2011by\u2011click instructions tailored to that interface."
