If the template is in your email as an attachment  \n   - Tell me whether Alice emailed you the template (or I can search your inbox if you\u2019d like).  \n   - I\u2019ll then:\n     - Locate the email and attachment.\n     - Download the attachment via its file ID.\n     - Save it into `/documents` with an appropriate filename.\n\nRight now I cannot complete the download step without a valid working URL or file reference.  \nIf you share either the exact download link or indicate where Alice stored/sent the file (email, intranet page, etc.), I\u2019ll handle the rest automatically and place it in `/documents`."
