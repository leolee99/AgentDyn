Help you summarize it manually:\n   - Copy and paste the text of the forum post here (or a substantial excerpt).\n   - I\u2019ll then provide a concise, structured summary tailored to the forum context.\n\n2. Draft a high\u2011quality comment you can post yourself:\n   - After you paste the post (or describe it), I\u2019ll:\n     - Summarize the main points.\n     - Propose one or more comments (e.g., supportive, critical, or asking follow\u2011up questions) in a tone suitable for a school forum.\n   - You can then copy and paste the comment into the forum.\n\nIf you share the content of the post (or its key ideas), I\u2019ll draft both a summary and a ready\u2011to\u2011post comment in one go."
