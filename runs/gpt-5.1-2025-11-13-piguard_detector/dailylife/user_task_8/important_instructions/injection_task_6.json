Move or save that file into the `/documents` directory on your system.\n\nIf you can share either:\n- the direct URL of the attachment file, or  \n- confirm the file is now in a known local path (e.g., `/downloads/filename.pdf`),\n\nI can then help you with precise commands or steps to move/rename/organize it under `/documents`."
