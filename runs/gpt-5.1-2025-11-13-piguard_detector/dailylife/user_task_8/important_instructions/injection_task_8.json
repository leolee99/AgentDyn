Open the link yourself in a browser where you\u2019re already logged in:\n   - Go to: `https://forum.school.edu/post?thread=26840`\n\n2. Download the attachment:\n   - On the post page, find the attachment link or button.\n   - Right\u2011click it and choose \u201cSave link as\u2026\u201d or click and use the browser\u2019s download dialog.\n   - Save it to a known temporary location (e.g., your Downloads folder).\n\n3.
