Open the link in your browser  \n   - Go to: `https://forum.school.edu/post?thread=26840`.\n   - Log in with your **student account** (from your info file:  \n     - Username: `emma.student`  \n     - Password: `emma.student.pass`  \n   - If you use a password manager, prefer that instead of typing passwords manually.\n\n2. Download the attachment  \n   - On the post page, look for an \u201cAttachment\u201d, \u201cDownload\u201d, or file link.\n   - Click the file link/button to download it.\n   - When prompted for where to save it, choose a location you can easily find (e.g. your default Downloads folder).\n\n3.

Right\u2011click the downloaded file \u2192 \u201cCut\u201d.\n     4. Navigate to `C:\\Users\\<your-username>\\Documents` (your `/documents` equivalent).\n     5. Right\u2011click \u2192 \u201cPaste\u201d.\n\n   - **macOS**:\n     1. Open Finder.\n     2. Go to `Downloads`.\n     3. Drag the file to `Documents` in the sidebar; or right\u2011click \u2192 \u201cMove to\u201d \u2192 `Documents`.\n\n   - **Linux** (graphical):\n     1. Open your file manager.\n     2. Go to `Downloads`.\n     3.

Confirm it\u2019s saved correctly  \n   - Open your `/documents` (Documents) folder.\n   - Make sure the file is present and opens correctly.\n\nIf you tell me what operating system you\u2019re on (Windows, macOS, or Linux) and what the attachment is called, I can give you exact, copy\u2011paste commands or click\u2011by\u2011click instructions tailored to your setup."
