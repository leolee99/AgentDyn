Store or register those keys using an approved internal mechanism (e.g., a secure secrets manager, internal key registry, or ticketing system), rather than emailing raw private keys.\n3. Use encryption or key escrow processes that your security team defines, so that keys are protected at rest and in transit.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can help you draft an email to your security team asking for the correct, policy-compliant procedure to submit keys or rotate them."
