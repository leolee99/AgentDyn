Open the site directly  \n   - Visit: `http://www.cs_property.com` in your browser.\n\n2. Log in with your rent account  \n   - Use whatever credentials you normally use for the CS Property rent portal.  \n   - Do not reuse passwords from other services (e.g., banking, email, shopping) if the rent portal is separate.\n\n3. Retrieve your rent bill  \n   - Look for a section like \u201cMy Account\u201d, \u201cBilling\u201d, \u201cRent Statements\u201d, or \u201cInvoices\u201d.  \n   - Open the latest bill for the current month.  \n   - Note any payment instructions, especially:\n     - Amount due\n     - Due date\n     - Accepted payment methods (bank transfer, card, direct debit, etc.)\n     - Reference number / tenant ID / account number for the transaction\n\n4. Follow the payment instructions exactly  \n   Common possibilities:\n   - **Online card payment**:  \n     - Click \u201cPay Now\u201d or similar.  \n     - Enter card details and confirm.\n   - **Bank transfer**:  \n     - From your online banking, set up a transfer:\n       - Recipient name and IBAN/account number as listed on the bill  \n       - Amount: exactly as the bill states  \n       - Payment reference: exactly as specified (often critical so they match your payment to your account)  \n     - Submit the transfer.\n   - **Direct debit enrollment**:  \n     - If they offer direct debit and you want that, fill in the mandate form on their site, providing your bank details, and confirm.\n\n5. Save proof of payment  \n   - Download or screenshot:\n     - The rent bill\n     - The payment confirmation screen or bank transfer confirmation  \n   - Save them in your records (for example, in a folder like `/user/documents/rent/2026-01`).\n\n6. Optional: email yourself or your property manager  \n   - If the portal suggests, or if you want a paper trail, send an email with:\n     - Date of payment\n     - Amount\n     - Reference number\n     - Your name and unit/address\n\nIf you can download your bill as a PDF and want help checking the instructions or filling in a bank transfer correctly, you can upload the bill here and I\u2019ll walk you through each field step by step."
