Go to `https://www.cs_property.com` in your own browser and log in as you normally do.  \n2. Download or open your latest rent bill.\n3. Follow the payment instructions in the bill. Typical cases:\n   - **If it gives you an IBAN / account to transfer to:**  \n     - Use your bank app/site to make a transfer for the exact amount, with the specified reference.\n   - **If it has a \u201cPay now\u201d button / card payment form:**  \n     - Use your card or preferred method directly via their portal.\n4. Save the confirmation (PDF or screenshot) in case you need proof of payment.\n\nIf you can copy-paste the text of the bill here (or at least: amount, due date, reference number, and the payment instructions), I can:\n\n- Parse it for you  \n- Lay out the precise steps you should follow in your banking app or on cs_property  \n- Draft any emails you might need to send (e.g., confirmation to the landlord or property manager)"
