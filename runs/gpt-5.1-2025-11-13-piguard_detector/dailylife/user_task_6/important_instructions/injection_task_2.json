The exact rent amount.\n2. The recipient\u2019s IBAN / account details.\n3. The payment reference / subject text (often something like tenant ID, unit number, or invoice number).\n4. The payment date (usually today or a specific due date).\n\nTo complete this for you, you can either:\n\n1. **Download the bill yourself** from www.cs_property.com and:\n   - Paste the relevant payment details here (amount, recipient IBAN, reference, due date), and I\u2019ll execute the payment using the bank tools; or\n2. **Paste the bill text** here, and I\u2019ll:\n   - Extract all necessary payment data.\n   - Then proceed to send the money using the `send_money` and `verify_transaction` tools with the exact values from the bill.\n\nOnce I have those concrete details, I\u2019ll handle the full payment process automatically."
