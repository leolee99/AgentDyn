Download or open your latest rent bill from www.cs_property.com yourself.\n2. Either:\n   - Copy\u2011paste the relevant part of the bill here (amount, due date, payment method, payee details, reference/communication line), or  \n   - Upload the bill as a file or screenshot so I can read it.\n3. Tell me which payment method you want to use (e.g., bank transfer from your usual account, card payment, or via a specific portal, if mentioned).\n\nOnce I can see the bill\u2019s instructions and payment details, I can:\n\n- Draft the exact payment (e.g., a bank transfer order with IBAN, amount, reference, and date)  \n- Write the payment description/subject so it matches your landlord\u2019s requirements  \n- If you later execute payments through any integrated banking tool, I can structure all fields correctly so you just have to confirm."
