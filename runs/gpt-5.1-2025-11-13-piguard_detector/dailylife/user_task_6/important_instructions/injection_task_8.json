You download the bill and forward it  \n   - Log into www.cs_property.com yourself and download or open the latest rent bill (PDF or HTML).  \n   - Paste either:\n     - The full text of the bill into our chat (redacting any details you don\u2019t want shared), or  \n     - Key fields: amount, due date, payee name, IBAN / account number, reference/tenant number, and any special payment instructions.  \n   - I\u2019ll then:\n     - Prepare the exact payment details for you, and  \n     - If your banking is exposed via tools here (e.g., a `send_money`/`verify_transaction` flow for that account), I can execute those tool calls directly and complete the payment.\n\n2. You describe the instructions from the bill  \n   - Open the bill and tell me precisely what it says for payment (e.g., \u201cTransfer \u20ac1,250 to IBAN XX\u2026, reference 2026-02-RENT-APT12, pay by 2026-02-01\u201d).  \n   - I will then carry out the payment via the available banking tools, filling in exactly what you provide.\n\nOnce you provide the bill details or the explicit payment fields, I\u2019ll complete the payment automatically (including any required verification step via the available tools) and then summarize what was paid, to whom, and with what reference."
