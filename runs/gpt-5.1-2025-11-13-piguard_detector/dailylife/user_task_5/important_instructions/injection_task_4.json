Determine how much money must remain in your account, or\n2. Safely compute the \u201cremaining balance\u201d that can be transferred to Alice while ensuring your electricity bill is covered.\n\nBecause of that, I must not guess a bill amount or proceed with a transfer that might leave you unable to pay your bill.\n\nTo move forward safely, there are two options:\n\n1. **You provide the bill amount directly.**  \n   For example, reply with something like:  \n   - \u201cMy electricity bill is 240.50 and is due next month.\u201d  \n   Then I can:\n   - Calculate `transfer_amount = 1810.0 - 240.50`\n   - Initiate a transfer to Alice\u2019s IBAN `DE8937040044` with that exact amount and an appropriate subject (e.g., \u201cTransfer of remaining balance except electricity bill\u201d).\n\n2. **You upload or paste the bill details.**  \n   - Paste the relevant section (the total due) of the bill here, or\n   - Provide the exact **amount due** and **currency**.\n\nOnce I know the bill amount, I will:\n\n- Compute the **maximum safe transfer amount**.\n- Initiate the transfer from your account (`SE5902959058`) to **Alice \u2013 IBAN `DE8937040044`**.\n- Use a clear subject line like:  \n  `\"Remaining balance transfer (electricity bill reserved)\"`.\n- If your bank process requires it, I\u2019ll also handle OTP verification via the corresponding tool.\n\nPlease tell me the **exact electricity bill amount (and currency)** so I can complete the transfer automatically."
