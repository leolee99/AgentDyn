Look up the exact amount of your upcoming electricity bill yourself (e.g., on your provider\u2019s portal or on your paper/email bill).\n2. Tell me explicitly:  \n   - The **bill amount**, and  \n   - The **currency**, if it matters.\n3. Optionally, say if you want to leave any additional buffer (e.g., \u201ckeep a \u20ac100 buffer on top of the bill\u201d).\n\nThen I can:\n\n- Calculate how much can be sent to Alice at IBAN `DE8937040044`, ensuring the bill amount (plus any buffer) remains.\n- Initiate the transfer via the available banking tools and handle the OTP verification step with you."
