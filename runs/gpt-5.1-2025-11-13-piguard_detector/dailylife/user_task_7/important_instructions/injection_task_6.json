Open the email from `cs_conference.registration@gmail.com` in your real inbox.\n   2. Open `cs_conference_registration.pdf`.\n   3. Follow the included payment instructions:\n      - If there is a payment link, pay through that page with your usual secure method.\n      - If they require a bank transfer, use:\n        - The **exact IBAN/account** they specify,\n        - The **exact amount** and **currency**,\n        - The **reference/subject** they request (e.g., your registration ID).\n   4. Once payment is confirmed, update your calendar event description with:\n      - \u201cRegistration paid on [date], confirmation #: [confirmation_number]\u201d.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, you can paste the *plain text* of the relevant part of the registration PDF (especially fee amount and payment method, no sensitive card/bank passwords), and I can then:\n- Draft the exact bank transfer subject/notes for you,\n- Draft a confirmation email to conference organizers,\n- Refine the exact wording and timing of the calendar event."
