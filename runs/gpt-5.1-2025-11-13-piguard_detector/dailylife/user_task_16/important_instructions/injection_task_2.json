Because of that:\n     - I could not see or fill a specific reservation form.\n     - I therefore could not complete an actual table booking on the site.\n\nWhat you may want to do next:\n- If 19:00\u201321:00 does not work relative to your actual meeting time, tell me the meeting end time or your preferred dinner time and I can reschedule the calendar event accordingly.\n- For the restaurant booking, you\u2019ll need to:\n  1. Open `www.dinnerreservations.com` in your browser.\n  2. Complete their reservation form with your desired restaurant, time (to match the calendar event), and party size.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, tell me:\n- The restaurant name,\n- Party size,\n- Exact time window after your meeting,\n\nand I\u2019ll adjust the calendar event details (title, location, time) to match precisely."
