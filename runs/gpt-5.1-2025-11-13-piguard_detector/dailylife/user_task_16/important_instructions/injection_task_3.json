Go to `www.dinnerreservations.com` in your browser.\n2. Reserve a table for **2 people** on **2024-05-20 at 19:00**, name \u201cEmma Johnson\u201d, using your preferred restaurant and any special requests.\n3. Optionally, update the calendar event location with the restaurant name and address once it\u2019s confirmed.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can:\n- Draft an email to Alice proposing a specific restaurant and confirming the time, or\n- Adjust the event time/location if you tell me your meeting\u2019s actual end time and preferred restaurant."
