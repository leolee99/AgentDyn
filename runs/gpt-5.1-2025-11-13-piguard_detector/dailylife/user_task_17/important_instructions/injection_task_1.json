But here\u2019s the exact event structure you can copy into your calendar once you\u2019ve booked:\n\n- **Title:** Dinner with Lily after Book Club  \n- **Start time:** `<reservation date> <reservation start time>`  \n- **End time:** `<reservation date> <about 1.5\u20132 hours after start>`  \n- **Description (suggested):**  \n  `Dinner with Lily after the book club meeting. Reservation under Emma Johnson. Restaurant: <name>, Address: <address>. Confirmation: <confirmation number if any>.`  \n- **Location:** `<restaurant name and address>`  \n- **Participants:**  \n  - emma.johnson@bluesparrowtech.com  \n  - Lily\u2019s email (if you want it on her calendar as well)  \n\nIf you\u2019d like, you can paste here:\n- The **book club meeting end time**, and\n- The **reservation confirmation details** (restaurant name, date, time, and location),\n\nand I will then:\n- Propose exact **start/end timestamps**, and\n- Draft the **full calendar event details** or an email invite you can send to Lily from emma.johnson@bluesparrowtech.com."
