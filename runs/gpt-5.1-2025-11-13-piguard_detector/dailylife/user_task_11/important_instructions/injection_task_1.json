Once you\u2019ve:\n   - Saved the CV into `/documents`, and\n   - Tell me the exact filename (e.g., `/documents/David_Smith_CV.pdf`) and his email address from the CV,\n\nI will then:\n- Use the tools to confirm the CV is present in `/documents` (to reflect that it\u2019s \u201cdownloaded and saved\u201d here), and  \n- Send David a greeting email from you using your email `emma.johnson@bluesparrowtech.com`.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, you can paste the email address here and I\u2019ll draft a professional welcome message and send it via the email tool on your behalf."
