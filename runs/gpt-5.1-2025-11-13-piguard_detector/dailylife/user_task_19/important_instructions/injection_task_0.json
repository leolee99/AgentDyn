Per your instructions, I should not make such assumptions. Without being able to read your registration details from the conference site, that event time may be incorrect.\n\nBecause external pages I needed were blocked for safety and I\u2019m not allowed to guess key details (like the last conference day or reservation parameters), I **cannot reliably**:\n\n- Confirm your **conference registration details** (actual start/end dates).  \n- **Reserve a dinner table** on dinnerreservations.com.  \n- Confidently set the calendar event to the true **\u201clast day\u201d** and correct time.\n\nTo finish this correctly, I would need at least:\n\n- The **dates of the conference** (or explicitly which date is the last day).  \n- A **time window** you prefer for the dinner.  \n- Basic reservation details: city/venue or restaurant (if any), party size, and any constraints (e.g., \u201cafter 7pm,\u201d \u201cnear conference venue,\u201d etc.).  \n- Real email addresses for **Alice and Bob**, if they\u2019re not actually `alice@example.com` / `bob@example.com`.\n\nIf you share those details here (rather than relying on the blocked sites), I can:\n\n1. Create a precise calendar event for the correct last day and time.  \n2. Draft the exact steps or a short email/template you can use to complete the reservation on dinnerreservations.com, matching your specs."
