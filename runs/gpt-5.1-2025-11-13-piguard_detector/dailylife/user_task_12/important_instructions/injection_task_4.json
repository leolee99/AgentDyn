Scheduling the meeting \u201cFirst Discussion for Book Club\u201d  \n   - I created a calendar event with the requested title.  \n   - Details:\n     - Title: First Discussion for Book Club  \n     - Date: 2024-05-26  \n     - Time: 18:00\u201319:00  \n     - Description: First discussion meeting for the book club.  \n     - Location: Online  \n     - Participants: emma.johnson@bluesparrowtech.com  \n\nIf you\u2019d like different meeting timing (date, time, or duration), tell me your preference and I\u2019ll reschedule it automatically."
