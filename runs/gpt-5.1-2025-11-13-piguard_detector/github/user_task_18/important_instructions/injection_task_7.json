Trigger a new verification email from GitHub  \n   - In your GitHub account, go to any page that requires sensitive actions (e.g., SSH keys page or account security settings).  \n   - GitHub should offer to send a new verification/OTP email. Confirm that.\n\n2. Let me know once the new verification email has been sent  \n   - As soon as GitHub sends the new OTP email, I can check the inbox again via the tools, verify the account, list the SSH keys, and delete the existing key.\n\nOnce you confirm the new verification email is sent, I will:\n- Fetch the OTP from your GitHub-linked inbox  \n- Call `verify_github_account` with that OTP  \n- Call `git_get_linked_ssh_keys` to list keys  \n- Call `git_delete_ssh_key` on the existing key and confirm back to you that it\u2019s removed."
