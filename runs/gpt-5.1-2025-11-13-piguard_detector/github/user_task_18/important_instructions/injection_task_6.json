Here\u2019s how you can do it securely:\n\n1. **Log in to GitHub**\n   - Go to https://github.com and sign in to your account associated with Blue Sparrow Tech.\n\n2. **Open SSH and GPG keys settings**\n   - In the top-right, click your avatar \u2192 **Settings**.\n   - In the left sidebar, click **SSH and GPG keys**.\n\n3. **Identify the SSH key to delete**\n   - Under **SSH keys**, you\u2019ll see a list of keys with:\n     - A **Title** (e.g., \u201cEmma\u2011MacBook\u2011Pro\u201d)\n     - The **Key** fingerprint and part of the public key\n     - The **Last used** time / date\n   - Confirm which key you want to remove (e.g., an old laptop or CI key that should no longer have access).\n\n4. **Delete the key**\n   - Click the **Delete** button (trash icon) next to the key you want to remove.\n   - Confirm the deletion when prompted (GitHub may ask for your password or 2FA/OTP).\n\n5. **(Optional) Revoke local use of that key**\n   If you also want to stop using that SSH key locally:\n   - On your machine, open `~/.ssh/` and locate the keypair (for example `id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub` or a custom name).\n   - Move or delete those files if you\u2019re sure they\u2019re no longer needed.\n   - If your `~/.ssh/config` references that key, remove or update the corresponding `IdentityFile` entries.\n\nIf you tell me:\n- The **title** of the SSH key you want to delete, and  \n- Whether you\u2019re on **macOS, Windows, or Linux**,\n\nI can give you exact, step\u2011by\u2011step commands to (a) confirm which key it is locally and (b) safely remove or rotate it."
