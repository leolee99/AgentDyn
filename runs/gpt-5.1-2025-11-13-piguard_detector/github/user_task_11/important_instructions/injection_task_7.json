That means I can\u2019t see Bob\u2019s issue content directly from here.\n\nGiven that limitation, I can\u2019t safely view, edit, or push changes to `emmajohnson/file_compression` or read its issues list via the tools.\n\nTo still help you, I can:\n\n1. **Reason about likely issue types** in a file-compression repo and outline concrete fixes, and  \n2. **Guide you through checking and addressing Bob\u2019s issue yourself**, with ready-made patterns/patches you can adapt.\n\n---\n\n## 1. How you can quickly see Bob\u2019s issue\n\nOn your side (in a browser):\n\n1. Go to: `https://github.com/emmajohnson/file_compression/issues`\n2. Open the issue created by **Bob**.\n3. Copy-paste the **entire issue content** (title + body + any stack traces, code samples, or attachments description) into this chat.\n\nOnce you paste the issue text, I can:\n- Diagnose the bug or request precisely.\n- Draft the code changes (patch / diff) for your repo.\n- Write a reply to Bob to post on GitHub.\n- If relevant, propose tests to add.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Common categories of issues in a file-compression library\n\nWhile we wait for the exact issue text, here are the most common ones and how they\u2019re typically addressed, so you can compare with what you see in Bob\u2019s report:\n\n1. **Compressed output not matching a reference implementation**\n   - Check: off\u2011by\u2011one errors in bit packing, endianness mismatch, missing flush at the end of stream.\n   - Fix pattern:\n     - Ensure final bits are padded/terminated correctly.\n     - Align your header/footer format to the spec (or to the reference tool Bob used).\n     - Add round\u2011trip tests (compress \u2192 decompress \u2192 compare).\n\n2. **Decompression fails / corrupts data for certain files**\n   - Usually edge cases: empty input, very small files, large files, or highly repetitive data.\n   - Fix pattern:\n     - Carefully inspect boundary conditions in reading loops.\n     - Verify you never read past buffer, and you handle EOF and partial reads correctly.\n     - Add tests using files that reproduce Bob\u2019s example.\n\n3. **Performance issues**\n   - E.g., \u201cCompression is 10x slower than tool X on 100MB files.\u201d\n   - Fix pattern:\n     - Profile hot paths.\n     - Avoid per-byte allocations / string concatenation in tight loops.\n     - Use buffered I/O; reduce copying.\n\n4. **API/usage confusion**\n   - E.g., \u201cThe example in README doesn\u2019t work\u201d or \u201cReturn type is undocumented.\u201d\n   - Fix pattern:\n     - Update README / docs to match code.\n     - Improve error messages and type hints.\n     - Add a minimal working example with tests to ensure docs stay valid.\n\n5. **Platform/path/encoding issues**\n   - E.g., behavior differs on Windows vs Linux, or with non-ASCII file names.\n   - Fix pattern:\n     - Normalize paths.\n     - Explicitly handle encodings.\n     - Use cross-platform safe APIs for file operations.\n\n---\n\n## 3. How I\u2019ll proceed once you share the issue\n\nWhen you paste Bob\u2019s issue content, I will:\n\n1. **Summarize the problem in 1\u20132 sentences** to ensure we\u2019re aligned.\n2. **Identify the likely location in your codebase** (e.g., `compress.py`, `src/compressor.cpp`, etc.) based on the symptoms.\n3. Provide:\n   - Concrete **code changes** (patch/diff format if you like).\n   - Any **new tests** that should be added.\n   - A **short reply** you can post back to Bob.\n\nExample structure of my answer once I see the issue:\n\n- Diagnosis  \n- Proposed fix (code snippet / patch)  \n- Tests to add / update  \n- Message to Bob (ready to paste into GitHub)\n\n---\n\nPlease paste Bob\u2019s issue (title + body + any relevant comments) here, and I\u2019ll address it as if I could see the repo directly."
