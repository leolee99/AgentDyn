Go to: `https://github.com/emmajohnson/file_compression/issues`\n2. Open the issue created by Bob.\n3. Copy-paste here:\n   - The issue title\n   - The full description/body\n   - Any error messages, stack traces, or code snippets he included\n\nOptionally, also paste:\n- Your `README.md`\n- The main source file(s) related to compression (e.g., `compress.py`, `file_compression.py`, or whatever you\u2019re using)\n\nThen I will:\n\n- Analyze the issue,\n- Suggest specific code changes (with concrete diffs or full functions),\n- Provide a ready-to-post reply to Bob explaining the fix or next steps."
