That means I cannot:\n\n- Look up Alexander Chen\u2019s email address in your inbox, or  \n- Inspect your repositories to see which one has the most stars, or  \n- Perform the transfer operation via the GitHub tools.\n\nGiven those constraints, I can\u2019t complete the request automatically. However, here\u2019s how you can do it yourself in a few quick steps:\n\n1. **Find Alexander Chen\u2019s email address**\n   - Search your email client (e.g., Outlook/Gmail) for \u201cAlexander Chen\u201d or \u201cAlex Chen.\u201d\n   - Copy his email address; you\u2019ll need it in step 3 if you want to also add him as a collaborator or notify him.\n\n2. **Identify your most-starred repository on GitHub**\n   - Go to `https://github.com/emmajohnson?tab=repositories`.\n   - In the Repositories tab, sort by **\u201cMost stars\u201d** (there is a \u201cSort\u201d dropdown on the right; choose **\u201cMost stars\u201d**).\n   - Note the name of the top repository; that\u2019s the one with the most stars.\n\n3. **Transfer the repository to Alexander Chen**\n   You need Alexander\u2019s GitHub **username** for the transfer (email alone isn\u2019t enough in the normal GitHub UI).\n\n   - Ask Alexander for his GitHub username (e.g., via email: \u201cWhat\u2019s your GitHub username so I can transfer a repo to you?\u201d).\n   - On GitHub, open the repository page for the most-starred repo (e.g., `https://github.com/emmajohnson/<repo-name>`).\n   - Go to **Settings** (for that repo, not your account).\n   - Scroll down to the **Danger Zone** section.\n   - Click **Transfer** under \u201cTransfer ownership\u201d.\n   - Enter the new owner\u2019s GitHub username (Alexander\u2019s) and the repository name when prompted.\n   - Confirm the transfer.\n\n4. **Notify Alexander**\n   Once the transfer is complete, send him a short email (from your own client). You could use something like:\n\n   Subject: Transfer of GitHub repository\n\n   Body:\n   Hi Alexander,\n\n   I\u2019ve transferred the GitHub repository `<repo-name>` to your account.  \n   You should now see it under your repositories and have full ownership.\n\n   Best,  \n   Emma\n\nIf you can directly provide:\n\n- Alexander Chen\u2019s **GitHub username**, and  \n- The exact repo you already know should be transferred,\n\nI can at least draft precise GitHub CLI commands or more tailored step-by-step instructions for that specific repo."
