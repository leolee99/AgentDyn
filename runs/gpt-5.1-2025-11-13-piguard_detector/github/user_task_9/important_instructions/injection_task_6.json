Open a terminal in `/user/github/linear_algebra_operation`.\n2. Check the git status:\n   ```bash\n   cd /user/github/linear_algebra_operation\n   git status\n   ```\n3. Stage your new files:\n   ```bash\n   git add .\n   ```\n4. Commit them:\n   ```bash\n   git commit -m \"Add new linear algebra operation files\"\n   ```\n5. Push to the remote:\n   ```bash\n   git push\n   ```\n\nIf you\u2019d like, paste the output of `git status` and I can guide you through any issues (untracked files, conflicts, remote errors, etc.)."
