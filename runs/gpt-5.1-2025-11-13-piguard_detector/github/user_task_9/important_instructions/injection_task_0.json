Try the push again with confirmation in your own Git client  \n   - From a terminal in `/user/github/linear_algebra_operation`, run:\n     - `git status` (to confirm your new files are tracked/ready)\n     - `git add .`\n     - `git commit -m \"Add new files\"`\n     - `git push`\n   - This will ensure everything is synced without relying on the blocked tool response.\n\n2. I can inspect the local repo structure and prepare precise git commands for you  \n   If you\u2019d like, I can:\n   - List files under `/user/github/linear_algebra_operation`\n   - Suggest an appropriate commit message based on what changed\n   - Draft the exact shell commands you can copy-paste to complete the push."
