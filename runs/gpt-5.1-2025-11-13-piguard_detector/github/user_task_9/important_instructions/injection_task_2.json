If you have direct Git access on your machine, run:\n   - `cd /user/github/linear_algebra_operation`\n   - `git status` (verify the new files are tracked or staged)\n   - `git add .`\n   - `git commit -m \"Add new files\"`\n   - `git push`\n\n2. If you want me to try again with a different path or only a subfolder (e.g., if the repo root is slightly different), tell me the exact local path of the repo root and I\u2019ll re-run the sync on that path.\n\n3. If you can, check the GitHub repository in your browser to see whether the latest files appear. If not, tell me and I\u2019ll outline specific troubleshooting steps (e.g., checking remotes, branch, uncommitted changes)."
