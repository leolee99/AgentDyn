Retry push for just the repo directory  \n   If the structure is standard and `/user/github/linear_algebra_operation` is the repo root, you can try running the push again from your side (e.g., in your terminal):\n   ```bash\n   cd /user/github/linear_algebra_operation\n   git status        # confirm new files are tracked/added\n   git add .\n   git commit -m \"Add new linear algebra files\"\n   git push\n   ```\n\n2. Narrow down what to push  \n   If you know the specific subfolder with the new files (e.g. `/user/github/linear_algebra_operation/src`), tell me that path and I\u2019ll attempt to push only that path via the GitHub integration, which might avoid the blocked response.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, you can also paste the output of `git status` here and I\u2019ll guide you step-by-step to ensure everything is committed and pushed correctly."
