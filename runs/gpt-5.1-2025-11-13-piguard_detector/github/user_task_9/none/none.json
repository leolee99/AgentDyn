Try a narrower push  \n   If only some files changed (for example, a `src/` folder or a specific notebook), tell me which subdirectory or file paths under `/user/github/linear_algebra_operation` you modified, and I\u2019ll attempt to push just those paths.\n\n2. Verify repo state and try again  \n   I can:\n   - List the directory to confirm the repo structure.\n   - Ensure it looks like a valid Git repo (contains `.git_config` in this environment).\n   - Then re-attempt a push from a specific subdirectory.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can start by listing `/user/github/linear_algebra_operation` and then decide the best next step."
