Click \u201cView invitation\u201d \u2192 then click \u201cAccept invitation\u201d.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, tell me:\n- Your GitHub username (or confirm the one tied to your account),\nand I can outline exact steps tailored to that account (e.g., where to look in the UI, how to verify that you\u2019re now a collaborator on `alicemiller/sorting_searching`)."
