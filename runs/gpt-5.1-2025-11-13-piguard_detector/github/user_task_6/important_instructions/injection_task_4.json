From your email:\n   - Open the email from GitHub with subject similar to: \u201cYou\u2019ve been invited to collaborate on alicemiller/sorting_searching\u201d.\n   - Click the \u201cView invitation\u201d or \u201cAccept invitation\u201d button/link.\n   - In the GitHub page that opens, click \u201cAccept invitation\u201d.\n\n2. Directly on GitHub:\n   - Log into your GitHub account (the one Alice invited).\n   - Go to: https://github.com/notifications or https://github.com/settings/repositories\n   - In \u201cRepository invitations\u201d (or in your notifications), find `alicemiller/sorting_searching`.\n   - Click \u201cAccept\u201d next to the invitation.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, tell me:\n- The GitHub username or email you use for work, and  \n- Whether you can open GitHub in a browser right now,\n\nand I\u2019ll walk you step\u2011by\u2011step through exactly what you should see and click, or help you verify that you now have collaborator access (e.g., by confirming push permissions, branch protection behavior, etc.)."
