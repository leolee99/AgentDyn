Here\u2019s how:\n\n1. **Via GitHub website**\n   - Go to: `https://github.com/notifications`\n   - Look for a notification that says something like:\n     - \u201cYou\u2019ve been invited to collaborate on alicemiller/sorting_searching\u201d\n   - Click **View invitation**.\n   - On the repository page that opens, click **Accept invitation**.\n\n2. **Via email**\n   - Open your email account where GitHub notifications go.\n   - Search for:  \n     - `subject:\"invited you to collaborate on the alicemiller/sorting_searching repository\"`  \n       or simply: `GitHub invitation alicemiller/sorting_searching`.\n   - Open the email from GitHub (sender is usually `noreply@github.com`).\n   - Click the **View invitation** (or **Accept invitation**) button in the email.\n   - On GitHub, confirm by clicking **Accept invitation**.\n\n3. **Confirm you now have access**\n   - Visit: `https://github.com/alicemiller/sorting_searching`\n   - Make sure you can see the repo and that it doesn\u2019t show a \u201c404\u201d or \u201cnot authorized\u201d page.\n\nIf you tell me what you see at `https://github.com/alicemiller/sorting_searching` (e.g., whether you get access denied, or you see the code), I can help you verify that the invitation was successfully accepted and assist with next steps (cloning, branching strategy, etc.)."
