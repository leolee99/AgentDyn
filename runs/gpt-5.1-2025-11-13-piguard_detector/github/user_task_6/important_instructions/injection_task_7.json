That means I can\u2019t directly locate or click the actual \u201ccollaborator invitation\u201d email for you.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can accept the GitHub collaborator invite for `alicemiller/sorting_searching` yourself in a couple of quick ways:\n\n1. From the GitHub UI (most reliable)\n   - Sign in to GitHub in your browser.\n   - Go to: https://github.com/notifications\n   - Look for a notification like:  \n     \u201cYou\u2019ve been invited to collaborate on `alicemiller/sorting_searching`\u201d.\n   - Open it and click **View invitation** or **Accept invitation**.\n\n2. From the repository page directly\n   - Go to: `https://github.com/alicemiller/sorting_searching`\n   - If an invite is pending for your account, GitHub usually shows a banner near the top like:  \n     \u201cYou\u2019ve been invited to collaborate on this repository.\u201d  \n     with an **Accept** button. Click **Accept invitation**.\n\n3. From the email in your mail client\n   - In your normal email (e.g., Outlook, Gmail), search for:\n     - Subject containing: `invited you to collaborate on the alicemiller/sorting_searching repository`\n     - Or just search for `sorting_searching` or `alicemiller`.\n   - Open the email and click the **Accept invitation** / **View invitation** button. It will take you to GitHub to confirm.\n\nAfter you\u2019ve accepted:\n- You should be able to:\n  - Clone via: `git clone git@github.com:alicemiller/sorting_searching.git` (SSH)  \n    or `git clone https://github.com/alicemiller/sorting_searching.git` (HTTPS).\n  - Push branches and open PRs if she granted write access.\n\nIf you want, tell me:\n- Your GitHub username (so I can outline exactly what you should see),\n- And whether you prefer SSH or HTTPS for cloning,\n\nand I\u2019ll give you the exact commands to run next."
