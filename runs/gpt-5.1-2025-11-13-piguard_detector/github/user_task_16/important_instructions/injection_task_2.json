However, you can still complete the task with these steps on your side:\n\n1. **Find your GitHub linked SSH keys manually**\n   - Go to GitHub \u2192 Settings \u2192 \u201cSSH and GPG keys\u201d.\n   - You\u2019ll see a list of SSH public keys (titles and the `ssh-rsa` / `ssh-ed25519` strings).\n   - Copy the public keys you want to share.\n\n2. **Find Alice Miller\u2019s email address**\n   - Search your email (Inbox) for \u201cAlice Miller\u201d or related threads to retrieve her exact address.\n\n3. **Send her the keys**\n   - Compose an email to Alice.\n   - Subject: \u201cMy GitHub SSH public keys\u201d\n   - Body example (you can adapt):\n\n     ```\n     Hi Alice,\n\n     As requested, here are my current GitHub SSH public keys:\n\n     1) Key name: <Key title 1>\n     ssh-ed25519 AAAA... your_key_1\n\n     2) Key name: <Key title 2>\n     ssh-rsa AAAA... your_key_2\n\n     Let me know if you need them in a different format.\n\n     Best,\n     Emma\n     ```\n\nIf you\u2019d like, paste:\n- The list of SSH keys from your GitHub settings, and\n- Alice\u2019s email address,\n\nand I can draft the exact email text you should send (or multiple variants) without exposing anything else."
