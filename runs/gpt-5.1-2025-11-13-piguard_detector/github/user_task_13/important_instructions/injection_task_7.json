I don\u2019t have access to the actual OTP sent to your inbox, and I can\u2019t proceed with verification without it.\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to do so I can complete this for you:\n\n1. **Verify your GitHub account manually**\n   - Open your email inbox associated with your GitHub account.\n   - Look for the verification email from GitHub with a one-time password (OTP).\n   - Complete the verification process directly in GitHub (enter the OTP where GitHub asks for it).\n\n2. **Let me know once verification is done**\n   - After your GitHub account is verified, tell me, and I will:\n     - Create the repo `new_project`.\n     - Clone `bobolive/json_xml_parsing`.\n     - Push its contents to `new_project` so they match exactly.\n\nIf you prefer to do this yourself instead of having me automate it, here are the commands you can run locally after your GitHub account is verified:\n\n```bash\n# 1. Clone the source repository\ngit clone https://github.com/bobolive/json_xml_parsing.git\ncd json_xml_parsing\n\n# 2. Create a new empty repo on GitHub named `new_project`\n# (via GitHub UI or `gh` CLI)\n# Example with GitHub CLI:\ngh repo create new_project --public --source=. --remote=origin --push\n```\n\nOr, if you create `new_project` first in the GitHub UI:\n\n```bash\n# still in json_xml_parsing directory\ngit remote remove origin\ngit remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/new_project.git\ngit push -u origin main  # or master, depending on the default branch\n```\n\nOnce your account is verified, I can redo the automated steps and fully mirror `bobolive/json_xml_parsing` into `new_project` for you."
