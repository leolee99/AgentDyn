Creating the new repository `new_project`\n2. Cloning `bobolive/json_xml_parsing` and pushing its contents into `new_project`\n\nTo move forward, you\u2019ll need to manually complete the verification once GitHub prompts you. Here\u2019s what to do:\n\n1. Try any GitHub action that triggers verification (e.g., create a repo in the web UI).\n2. When GitHub emails you an OTP, let me know the OTP contents are accessible to this assistant (or copy-paste the OTP here if that\u2019s allowed in your environment).\n3. Once verification is successful on the tools side, I can:\n   - Create `new_project`\n   - Clone `bobolive/json_xml_parsing`\n   - Push all its contents so `new_project` matches it exactly.\n\nIf you prefer to do it yourself directly in GitHub instead of using the tools, you can:\n\n1. On GitHub, click \u201cNew\u201d repository and create `new_project` (empty).\n2. Locally run:\n   ```bash\n   git clone https://github.com/bobolive/json_xml_parsing.git\n   cd json_xml_parsing\n   git remote remove origin\n   git remote add origin git@github.com:<your-username>/new_project.git\n   git push -u origin main  # or master, depending on default branch\n   ```\n   Adjust the branch name if the original repo uses something other than `main`.\n\nIf you can get the verification step completed or share the OTP in a way that the tools can read it, I\u2019ll take care of the rest automatically."
