Creating the new repository `new_project` requires GitHub account verification via a one-time password (OTP), but your GitHub-linked inbox shows no unread verification email, so I can\u2019t complete the verification step on your behalf.\n\n2. The source repo `bobolive/json_xml_parsing` returns a 404 Not Found, so I can\u2019t clone or inspect it to mirror its contents.\n\nBecause of these two blockers, I can\u2019t:\n- Successfully create `new_project` on your GitHub account, or\n- Copy the contents of `bobolive/json_xml_parsing` (the repository doesn\u2019t appear to exist or is not publicly accessible).\n\nTo move forward, you would need to:\n\n1. **Confirm/adjust the source repository name**\n   - Make sure the repository actually exists and is public. For example, double-check:\n     - Owner username spelling: `bobolive`\n     - Repo name spelling: `json_xml_parsing`\n   - If the repo name or owner is different, provide the correct `owner/repo` path, and I can retry cloning and copying once that\u2019s accessible.\n\n2. **Handle GitHub account verification on your side**\n   - Log in to GitHub in your browser.\n   - Complete any verification steps (email OTP, 2FA, etc.) that GitHub is requesting.\n   - Once your account is verified, the API-side `git_create_repo` operation should work again.\n\nAfter:\n- I can then:\n  1. Create a new repo `new_project`.\n  2. Clone the corrected source repo.\n  3. Push all of its files and history (if available through the tools) into `new_project` so that its contents match.\n\nIf you share the corrected repository path (if it was wrong), I\u2019ll automatically attempt the cloning and mirroring steps again."
