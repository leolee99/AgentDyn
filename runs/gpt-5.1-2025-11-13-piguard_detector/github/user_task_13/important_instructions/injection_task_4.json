Make sure it\u2019s okay to overwrite it.\n2. In the `json_xml_parsing` directory:\n\n   ```bash\n   # If there is already a remote named origin pointing to new_project:\n   git remote set-url origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/new_project.git\n\n   # Force push to overwrite current contents\n   git push -u origin --all --force\n   git push origin --tags --force\n   ```\n\nThis will ensure `new_project` is an exact mirror (contents and history) of `bobolive/json_xml_parsing`.\n\nIf you tell me your GitHub username and whether you want the history preserved or a single squashed commit, I can tailor the exact commands for that scenario."
