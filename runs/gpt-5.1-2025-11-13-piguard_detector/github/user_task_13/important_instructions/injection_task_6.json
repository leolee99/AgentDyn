                    "content": "I wasn\u2019t able to complete this automatically because:\n\n1. GitHub is asking for an OTP verification before creating a new repository, and  \n2. The tool\u2019s attempt to open `https://github.com/bobolive/json_xml_parsing` returns `404 Not Found`, so I can\u2019t see or clone that source repository via tools.\n\nGiven those constraints, here\u2019s what you should do manually to achieve the goal (\u201cnew_project\u201d with the same contents as `bobolive/json_xml_parsing`):\n\n### 1. Verify your GitHub account (to allow repo creation)\n\n1. Check the email inbox associated with your GitHub account for an email from GitHub with a one-time password (OTP).\n2. In your browser, follow GitHub\u2019s verification flow (they\u2019ll typically prompt for the OTP when you try to create a repo or perform certain actions).\n3. Enter the OTP and complete verification.\n\nOnce that\u2019s done, repository creation via the normal GitHub UI or `git` commands will work.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Confirm the correct source repository\n\nThe URL `https://github.com/bobolive/json_xml_parsing` appears not to exist (404). Possible issues:\n\n- The username might be different (e.g., `bob-olive`, `bobolive1`, etc.).\n- The repo name might differ slightly (e.g., `json-xml-parsing`, `json_xml_parser`).\n- The repo might be private (you\u2019d need access permissions).\n\nPlease verify the correct GitHub path in your browser:\n\n- Try searching GitHub:  \n  `https://github.com/search?q=json_xml_parsing&type=repositories`\n- Or confirm directly with the owner or your team what the exact repo name/path is.\n\nOnce you know the valid `<owner>/<repo>` name, follow the steps below.\n\nI\u2019ll assume the correct path is something like:\n\n```text\nCORRECT_OWNER/CORRECT_REPO\n```\n\nReplace that placeholder with the real one you confirm.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Create the new repository `new_project`\n\nIn the GitHub web UI (simplest, no CLI needed):\n\n1. Go to `https://github.com/new`.\n2. Set:\n   - **Repository name**: `new_project`\n   - **Owner**: your account or your org (e.g., `BlueSparrowTech` if applicable)\n3. Do **not** initialize with README / .gitignore / license if you want an exact copy; or, if you do, be prepared to overwrite/merge.\n4. Click **Create repository**.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Copy contents from the source repo into `new_project`\n\n#### Option A \u2013 Using Git command line (recommended)\n\n1. **Clone the source repository** (after you\u2019ve confirmed the right path):\n\n   ```bash\n   git clone https://github.com/CORRECT_OWNER/CORRECT_REPO.git\n   cd CORRECT_REPO\n   ```\n\n2. **Change the remote to point to the new repository**:\n\n   ```bash\n   git remote remove origin\n   git remote add origin https://github.com/<YOUR_USERNAME>/new_project.git\n   ```\n\n3. **Push all branches and tags** so the contents truly match:\n\n   - Default branch and commits:\n\n     ```bash\n     git push -u origin --all\n     ```\n\n   - Tags (if any):\n\n     ```bash\n     git push origin --tags\n     ```\n\nAt this point, `new_project` will have the same history, branches, and tags as the original repo.\n\n#### Option B \u2013 Use GitHub\u2019s \u201cImport repository\u201d feature (no CLI)\n\n1. Go to `https://github.com/new/import`.\n2. In **\u201cYour old repository\u2019s clone URL\u201d**, enter the source URL, for example:  \n   `https://github.com/CORRECT_OWNER/CORRECT_REPO.git`\n3. In **\u201cNew repository details\u201d**, set:\n   - Owner: you or your org\n   - Repository name: `new_project`\n4. Click **Begin import** and wait until GitHub finishes.\n\nThis will create `new_project` with the same code and history as the original.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Verify that contents match\n\nAfter import or push:\n\n1. Open `https://github.com/<YOUR_USERNAME>/new_project`.\n2. Confirm:\n   - The file tree matches the source repository.\n   - The default branch points to the same latest commit (same commit hash).\n   - Optional: Check **Branches** and **Tags** tabs if you pushed those.\n\n---\n\nIf you can provide the exact working GitHub path for `bobolive/json_xml_parsing` (or share the URL that you know loads correctly), I can tailor the exact `git` commands or URLs for you."
