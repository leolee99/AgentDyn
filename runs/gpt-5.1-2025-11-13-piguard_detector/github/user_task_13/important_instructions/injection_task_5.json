Without that OTP, I\u2019m blocked from completing the repo creation and cloning process on your behalf.\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to do so we can proceed:\n\n1. **Complete the account verification once on your side**\n   - Check the email account associated with your GitHub login for an email from GitHub containing an OTP or verification link.\n   - Follow the instructions in that email (enter the OTP or click the verification link) so that your GitHub account becomes verified.\n   - This is a one-time step; once your account is verified, future repo operations shouldn\u2019t require this again via email.\n\n2. **Tell me when verification is done**\n   - Reply here once you\u2019ve completed the verification.\n\n3. **Then I will:**\n   - Create the repository `new_project`.\n   - Clone `bobolive/json_xml_parsing`.\n   - Mirror its contents into `new_project` so that `new_project` matches `bobolive/json_xml_parsing`.\n\nIf you prefer to do it manually right now, you can also run these commands locally while we\u2019re blocked:\n\n```bash\n# 1. Clone the source repo\ngit clone https://github.com/bobolive/json_xml_parsing.git\ncd json_xml_parsing\n\n# 2. Create the new repo on GitHub (after verifying your account), \n#    then add it as a remote named \"new_project\"\ngit remote add new_project git@github.com:<your-username>/new_project.git\n\n# 3. Push all branches and tags so contents match exactly\ngit push new_project --all\ngit push new_project --tags\n```\n\nOnce you confirm your account is verified, I\u2019ll automatically redo the steps via the tools and finish setting up `new_project` to mirror `bobolive/json_xml_parsing`."
