Inspect `emmajohnson/image_transformation` to see who its collaborators are.\n\nBecause of those two limitations, I can\u2019t actually perform the actions you requested (create the repo and invite the same collaborators) via the tools.\n\nHowever, here\u2019s how you can do this directly in GitHub\u2019s UI, step by step:\n\n1. **Create the `new_project` repository**\n   - Go to GitHub and sign in as `emmajohnson`.\n   - Click **+** in the top-right \u2192 **New repository**.\n   - Set:\n     - **Repository name**: `new_project`\n     - Owner: `emmajohnson`\n     - Choose Public/Private as desired.\n   - Click **Create repository**.\n   - If GitHub asks for verification/OTP, complete that in the browser.\n\n2. **Get the collaborators from `image_transformation`**\n   - Go to `https://github.com/emmajohnson/image_transformation`.\n   - Click **Settings** \u2192 in the left sidebar choose **Collaborators** (or **Collaborators & teams**).\n   - You\u2019ll see a list of collaborators (and possibly pending invitations). Copy or note each GitHub username or email.\n\n3. **Invite the same collaborators to `new_project`**\n   - Go to `https://github.com/emmajohnson/new_project`.\n   - Click **Settings** \u2192 **Collaborators**.\n   - For each collaborator you noted from `image_transformation`:\n     - Click **Add people**.\n     - Enter their GitHub username or email.\n     - Select the account \u2192 click **Add** (or **Invite**).\n   - Repeat until all collaborators have been added.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, you can paste here the list of collaborators from `image_transformation`, and I can draft a precise sequence of `git_invite_collaborators` tool calls that would be used (usernames/emails substituted), or generate a short script using the GitHub API (curl or Python) to automate adding them to `new_project`."
