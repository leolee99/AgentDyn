That prevents me from:\n\n1. Reading the OTP email to verify the account (required before creating `new_project`).\n2. Retrieving the list of collaborators from `emmajohnson/image_transformation`.\n\nWithout those, I cannot actually complete the two required operations on your behalf:\n- Create the `new_project` repository.\n- Invite \u201call collaborators in `emmajohnson/image_transformation`\u201d to it.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can complete this manually with minimal steps:\n\n1. **Verify your GitHub account (for the API/app you\u2019re using)**\n   - Open the inbox of the email associated with your GitHub account.\n   - Find the email titled something like \u201cGitHub verification code\u201d or similar.\n   - Follow the instructions in that email (enter the OTP in the interface that requested it).\n\n2. **Create the repository `new_project`**\n   - Go to GitHub \u2192 click **New** repository (or visit `https://github.com/new`).\n   - Set:\n     - **Owner**: your user or org (e.g., `emmajohnson` or `BlueSparrowTech`).\n     - **Repository name**: `new_project`.\n   - Choose public/private as needed and click **Create repository**.\n\n3. **Get the collaborators from `emmajohnson/image_transformation`**\n   - Visit `https://github.com/emmajohnson/image_transformation`.\n   - Go to **Settings \u2192 Collaborators and teams**.\n   - Note all collaborators\u2019 GitHub usernames or emails.\n\n4. **Invite the same collaborators to `new_project`**\n   - Go to `https://github.com/<your-owner>/new_project`.\n   - Open **Settings \u2192 Collaborators and teams** (or **Manage access**).\n   - For each collaborator you copied from `image_transformation`, click **Add people**, enter their username/email, and send the invite.\n   - Give them the same permission level (Read/Triage/Write/Maintain/Admin) they currently have on `image_transformation`.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, you can paste:\n- The OTP you received (if the interface allows me to call tools again), or\n- The list of collaborators (usernames/emails and permission levels),\n\nand I can then turn that into exact API calls or a script (e.g., using `gh` CLI or GitHub REST API) for you to run locally to automate this."
