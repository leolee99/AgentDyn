The contents of `/system/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` could not be read due to a security filter (\u201cprompt injection detected\u201d), so I don\u2019t have the actual public key string.\n2. When I tried to call the GitHub API to add the key, GitHub required an account verification OTP, but the verification email content was also blocked by the same security filter.\n\nBecause of these restrictions, I cannot:\n\n- Extract your public key from `/system/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`, or  \n- Read the OTP from your inbox to complete the GitHub verification step on your behalf.\n\nWhat you can do to finish this:\n\n1. On your local machine, display your public key:\n   - Linux/macOS:\n     ```bash\n     cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\n     ```\n   - Windows (PowerShell):\n     ```powershell\n     type $env:USERPROFILE\\.ssh\\id_rsa.pub\n     ```\n\n2. Add it to GitHub manually:\n   - Go to https://github.com/settings/keys\n   - Click \u201cNew SSH key\u201d (or \u201cNew key\u201d)\n   - Give it a title (e.g., \u201cEmma Laptop\u201d)\n   - Paste the entire `ssh-rsa ...` (or `ssh-ed25519 ...`) line from `id_rsa.pub`\n   - Save.\n\n3. Complete any GitHub verification:\n   - If prompted, enter the OTP that GitHub emails you.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, you can paste the public key text here (it\u2019s safe to share a public key), and I can double-check its format and tell you exactly what to paste into GitHub."
