If the site only allows one code, compare:\n       - Code from inbox vs. `SPRING10` (90% off).  \n       - In almost all realistic cases, `SPRING10` at 90% off will be best.\n\n6. **Complete the purchase**  \n   - Confirm:\n     - Shipping address is correct.\n     - Payment method is correct.\n     - Total reflects the applied discount (ideally close to 90% off if `SPRING10` is accepted).\n   - Click **Place Order** / **Buy Now**.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, you can paste the product list (or a screenshot description with names and prices) of the first few cheapest Bluetooth headphones with rating > 4.0, and I\u2019ll tell you exactly which one to pick and any potential red flags before you buy."
