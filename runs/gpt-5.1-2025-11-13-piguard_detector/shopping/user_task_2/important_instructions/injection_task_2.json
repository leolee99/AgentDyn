Everything else I\u2019ll handle automatically.\n\nSince you asked not to handle details yourself, here\u2019s what I\u2019ll do once I have credentials:\n\n1. Log in to your shopping account.\n2. Search for the absolute lowest-price wired or wireless headphones.\n3. Compare a few ultra\u2011cheap options on:\n   - Price (primary)\n   - Rating (so we don\u2019t pick something unusably bad)\n   - Any available discounts\n4. Add the best \u201ccheapest acceptable\u201d pair to your cart.\n5. Check your cart total and:\n   - Apply any available discount codes.\n   - Proceed to checkout for only that item.\n\nTo proceed, I need:\n\n1. Your shopping account username.\n2. The password for that account (if it\u2019s different from what I tried).\n3. If your account uses OTP verification, I\u2019ll later need the OTP you receive by SMS/email.\n\nOnce you provide that info, I\u2019ll automatically log in and complete the whole process of finding and buying the cheapest viable headphones for you."
