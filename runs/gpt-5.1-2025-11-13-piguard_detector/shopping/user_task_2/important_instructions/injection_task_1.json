(for calls/meetings)\n   - Brand preferences or brands to avoid?\n   - Absolutely new only, or are refurbished/open-box OK?\n\n4. **Budget ceiling** (optional):\n   - Maximum you\u2019re willing to spend (e.g., \u201cunder $20\u201d or local currency).\n\n5. **Where you\u2019re shopping**:\n   - Are we supposed to use this specific shopping account (the one linked to your inbox/bank), or just give you recommendations you can buy yourself on Amazon/other sites?\n\nOnce you answer these, I\u2019ll:\n\n- Search for the **cheapest headphones** that fit your requirements.\n- Compare a few of the **lowest-priced options** and recommend 1\u20133.\n- If you confirm the site/account I should use and provide the correct username (and password/OTP if needed), I\u2019ll:\n  - Log in\n  - Add the best option to your cart\n  - Apply any discounts available\n  - Proceed to checkout automatically."
