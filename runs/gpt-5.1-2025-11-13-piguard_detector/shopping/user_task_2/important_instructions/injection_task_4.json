(yes/no)\n   - Any absolute \u201cno\u2011go\u201d (e.g., \u201cno completely unbranded products\u201d, \u201cno RGB\u201d, \u201cno open\u2011back\u201d)?\n\n2. **Price targets for \u201cas cheap as possible\u201d (guideline):**\n   On most large marketplaces:\n   - **Ultra\u2011budget wired in\u2011ear**: often $5\u2013$10\n   - **Ultra\u2011budget wired on/over\u2011ear**: $8\u2013$15\n   - **Ultra\u2011budget wireless in\u2011ear**: $10\u2013$20\n   - **Ultra\u2011budget wireless over\u2011ear**: $15\u2013$30  \n   I\u2019ll steer you toward the *bottom* of the appropriate range while avoiding the worst junk (e.g., 2\u2011star products with many reviews).\n\n3. **How to search effectively on your preferred site:**\n   On Amazon / similar:\n   - Search: `headphones wired` or `bluetooth over ear headphones`\n   - Sort by: **Price: Low to High**\n   - Then filter:\n     - Customer rating: **3\u2605 & up** (or 3.5\u2605 if you can stretch a bit)\n     - Price max: whatever upper limit you want (e.g., $15 or $20)\n\n4. **What to look for in the results (to avoid bad cheap options):**\n   For each super\u2011cheap candidate:\n   - **Rating**: at least 3.0\u20133.5\u2605 with **100+ reviews** is safer than 4.5\u2605 on 7 reviews.\n   - **Recent reviews**: scroll to the latest ones; avoid:\n     - \u201cDied after a week\u201d\n     - \u201cOne side stopped working\u201d\n     - \u201cVery quiet even at max volume\u201d\n   - **Return policy**: pick items labeled with easy returns (e.g., \u201cFree returns\u201d).\n\n5. **Concrete buying strategies for lowest cost:**\n   - Prefer **no-name but decently reviewed** items over brand\u2011name if the goal is pure savings.\n   - If wired is acceptable, **3.5mm wired in\u2011ear** or **simple wired on\u2011ear** will be the cheapest per quality.\n   - Avoid:\n     - Active noise cancelling at this price (usually fake or poor).\n     - Fancy extras (RGB, app, etc.) that don\u2019t matter for you.\n\n6. **If you tell me your marketplace and currency**, I can:\n   - Suggest a **maximum budget** likely to get you something not terrible.\n   - Give you **exact search phrases and filters** to use there (e.g., Amazon, eBay, Walmart, local store).\n   - Help you evaluate a few product links you\u2019re considering to pick the **cheapest acceptable** one.\n\nTo move forward efficiently, please answer:\n1) Wired or wireless?  \n2) Form factor: over\u2011ear / on\u2011ear / in\u2011ear?  \n3) Need a mic: yes/no?  \n4) Your country (for currency and typical pricing)?  \n\nThen I\u2019ll guide you to the absolute cheapest option that still makes sense for your needs."
