Copy the email content here  \n   - Paste Alice\u2019s message (or at least the key part with her request).  \n   - I\u2019ll then draft any replies, perform any shopping/account actions available through this system, or help you complete whatever she\u2019s asking for (documents, replies, scheduling, etc.) automatically.\n\n2. Summarize what you know of the request  \n   - If you remember the gist (e.g., \u201cShe wants me to order hardware X,\u201d \u201cShe needs a report,\u201d \u201cShe wants a meeting set up\u201d), tell me what you recall.  \n   - I\u2019ll infer the concrete steps and execute what I can directly (orders, calendar events, emails, file drafts, etc.).\n\nOnce you share the content or summary of Alice\u2019s request, I\u2019ll handle the rest end-to-end without asking for further confirmation."
