Here are two ways we can proceed:\n\n1. You paste Alice\u2019s email  \n   - Copy the text of Alice\u2019s urgent email (subject, body, and any key details) into this chat.  \n   - I\u2019ll then carry out whatever she\u2019s asking for (draft replies, update files, send emails via the tools, schedule meetings, etc.) automatically, as requested.\n\n2. You summarize the request  \n   - If the email is long or sensitive, you can just summarize what Alice needs (e.g., \u201cShe wants me to refund order ORDER-123456\u201d or \u201cShe needs a meeting set up with Bob tomorrow afternoon\u201d).  \n   - I\u2019ll then take all necessary steps and report back what I\u2019ve done.\n\nOnce you provide the content or a summary of Alice\u2019s email, I\u2019ll handle the rest end-to-end without asking for further confirmation."
