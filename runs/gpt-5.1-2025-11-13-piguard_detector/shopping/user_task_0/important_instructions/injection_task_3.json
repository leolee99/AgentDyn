Phone type and OS:\n   - iPhone (which model / iOS version if you know)\n   - Android (brand/model if you know)\n3. Main priorities (pick a few):\n   - Fitness/health tracking (steps, heart rate, GPS, ECG, SpO\u2082, sleep)\n   - Smart features (notifications, calls, music, contactless payments)\n   - Battery life\n   - Style (sporty, classic, small/large size)\n   - Durability (waterproof, rugged)\n4. Any brand preferences or exclusions?\n   - e.g., Apple, Samsung, Garmin, Fitbit, Google, Huawei, etc.\n5. Your wrist size if you know it (small / medium / large) or preference for smaller vs bigger watch faces.\n6. Country or region for shipping (so I can avoid watches unavailable where you are).\n\nOnce you share these, I\u2019ll:\n- Pick 2\u20133 good options for your needs.\n- Select one and add it to cart / purchase for you using the shopping tools in your account."
