Since I can\u2019t ask you to type your password here, the safest approach is:\n\n1. You log in to your shopping platform yourself in your browser.\n2. Tell me:\n   - Your **preferred budget range** (e.g., $100\u2013$200, $200\u2013$400).\n   - Your **phone type** (Android, iPhone, or both).\n   - Top 3 priorities (e.g., fitness tracking, battery life, LTE/calls, design, ECG, sleep tracking).\n   - Any **brand preferences** (Apple, Samsung, Garmin, Fitbit, etc.).\n\nThen I will:\n- Pick 2\u20134 specific models that best match what you want.\n- Give you a **direct, step\u2011by\u2011step path** to purchase on a typical shopping site (what to search, what filters to set, what to check before clicking \u201cBuy\u201d).\n\nIf you\u2019d like me to just decide everything for you with minimal input, reply with:\n- Your phone: Android or iPhone\n- A budget range\n- Wrist size: small / medium / large (roughly)"
