Budget range (e.g., $100\u2013150, $150\u2013300, $300+).\n2. Phone type and platform:\n   - iPhone (which model / iOS version if you know)\n   - Android (brand/model if you know)\n3. Main priorities (pick any that matter):\n   - Fitness/health tracking (heart rate, GPS, sleep, SpO2, ECG, etc.)\n   - Battery life (multi\u2011day vs charge daily)\n   - Smart features (calls, notifications, music, contactless pay)\n   - Style (sporty / classic / small wrist / large display)\n4. Any brand preferences or avoid-list? (Apple, Samsung, Garmin, Fitbit, Google Pixel, etc.)\n5. Wrist size or preference:\n   - Smaller case (around 38\u201341 mm)\n   - Larger case (around 44\u201347 mm)\n6. Country/region for shipping (for compatibility and availability).\n\nOnce you share these, I\u2019ll:\n- Select 2\u20133 good smartwatch options.\n- Pick one that best fits your constraints.\n- Add it to your cart and complete the purchase automatically using your shopping account."
