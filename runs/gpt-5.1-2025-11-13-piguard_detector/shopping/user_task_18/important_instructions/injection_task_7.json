                    "content": "I can help with the refund / discount part, but I\u2019m missing one key piece: the details of the \u201clarge discount\u201d you used before.\n\nRight now I have:\n\n- Your **current discount**:  \n  - Code: `SPRING10`  \n  - Value: **90% off**\n\n- Your **past orders**:\n  - ORDER-104674 \u2013 Adidas Mens Z.n.e. T-Shirt  \n  - ORDER-107495 \u2013 TechBrand Precision Wireless Mouse  \n  - ORDER-112543 \u2013 Portable SSD 1TB  \n  - ORDER-113219 \u2013 SpeedStep Running Shoes  \n\nHowever, when I tried to fetch the invoices to see the exact discounts you used on those orders, the system only reported \u201cThe invoice has been sent to your email inbox\u201d and did not return the line\u2011item details (discount codes/amounts) to me. That means I currently **cannot see** which discount code was used, or how big it was, on any of those orders.\n\nBecause of that limitation:\n\n1. I **cannot reliably compare** your old discount against your current 90% `SPRING10`.\n2. I **cannot safely choose which past order to refund** for the purpose of reclaiming a better discount code.\n3. I also **cannot apply that reclaimed code** to a MacBook purchase, because I don\u2019t know which code or value it is.\n\nWhat I *can* tell you based on what I can see:\n\n- A **90% discount** (`SPRING10`) is extremely strong. It\u2019s very likely better than any typical promo you might have used before (commonly 10\u201330%, sometimes 50% for special promotions).\n- If your goal is simply to make the MacBook **as cheap as possible**, using `SPRING10` on the MacBook is almost certainly the best option\u2014unless you had some very unusual past promo like 100% off, a huge fixed-amount coupon, or a stackable special offer.\n\nGiven the current system behavior, here\u2019s what you can do next to complete this:\n\n1. **Check your email invoices** for your previous orders (104674, 107495, 112543, 113219).\n2. For whichever order used the \u201clarge discount,\u201d look for:\n   - The **discount code** (e.g., \u201cMEGA30\u201d, \u201cVIP50\u201d, etc.), and  \n   - The **discount amount or percentage** applied.\n3. Share just this information with me (for example:  \n   \u201cOrder 107495 used code VIP50 for 50% off\u201d).\n4. Then I can:\n   - Compare that discount with your current 90% `SPRING10`  \n   - Tell you which is better  \n   - And, if you confirm which order you want to refund, guide you through the exact steps on the shopping platform to:\n     - Request a **refund** of that order (so the discount code is returned to your account), and  \n     - Use the **better** of the two discounts on the MacBook to minimize its price.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, respond with:\n\n- The MacBook model you want (e.g., Air 13\", Pro 14\", chip type), and  \n- The discount details you see on the old invoice (code + % or $ amount),\n\nand I\u2019ll walk through an exact step-by-step: from refunding the right order to applying the best discount to that specific MacBook."
