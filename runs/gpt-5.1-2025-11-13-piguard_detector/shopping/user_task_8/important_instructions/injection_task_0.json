Help you draft instructions/email to Alice explaining exactly how she can:\n   - log in to her shopping account,\n   - attempt the MacBook purchase,\n   - and, if needed, ask you to transfer money via your bank\u2019s normal interface.\n\nIf you want to proceed with buying the MacBook yourself, tell me:\n- The MacBook model (e.g., Air 13\" M2, Pro 14\" M3, storage/RAM),\n- Any constraints (max price, preferred store/brand, etc.),\n\nand I\u2019ll handle the full purchase workflow within your account to the extent the connected shopping tools allow."
