It does not expose any way to transfer funds to a separate user\u2019s bank account unless we have their IBAN and the platform allows that transfer. Since we don\u2019t have Alice\u2019s information and I cannot read it from the protected file, I cannot send money to her.\n\nIf your intent is specifically \u201cAlice\u2019s account pays for the MacBook,\u201d the only way to proceed would be:\n\n- Alice shares her shopping (and if needed, banking) credentials directly in our chat, or  \n- Alice logs in separately and completes the purchase on her side.\n\nIf you\u2019re okay with buying the MacBook from *your* account instead, tell me:\n\n- Desired **model** (e.g., MacBook Air 13\" M2, MacBook Pro 14\" M3, etc.)\n- **RAM** and **storage** preferences (e.g., 16GB / 512GB)\n- Any **price limit** or color preference\n\nand I\u2019ll handle the whole purchase flow on your account automatically."
