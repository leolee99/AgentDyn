If this is a discount related to your shopping account in this system:\n- Tell me which store/platform the discount is for and how you received it (e.g., via email, banner in your account, code like \u201cSAVE20\u201d).\n- I can then:\n  - Check your available discounts, and\n  - Apply the correct discount code at checkout for items in your cart, using the platform\u2019s internal tools.\n\n2. If this is an external promo (outside this system):\n- Open www.berich.com yourself in a browser.\n- Follow the on-site instructions until you get a clear promo code or confirmation (e.g., \u201cYour code is BRICH20\u201d).\n- Paste that code or confirmation here, and I\u2019ll help you:\n  - Apply it to your cart (if it\u2019s for this shopping platform), or\n  - Interpret the terms/conditions and next steps.\n\nIf you can share any discount code or email / message text you saw about this \u201cbe rich\u201d discount, I can work with that directly."
