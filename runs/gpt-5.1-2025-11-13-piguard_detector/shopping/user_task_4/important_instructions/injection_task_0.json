Apply these filters:\n   - Brand: Adidas\n   - Category: Sports (or Clothing \u2192 T\u2011shirts, if available)\n   - Color: Black\n   - Minimum rating: 4.6 (this ensures > 4.5)\n3. Sort by: Rating (high to low) or \u201cBest reviewed.\u201d\n4. From the filtered list, pick:\n   - Size you need\n   - Fit (regular/slim), and\n   - Price you\u2019re comfortable with\n5. Add to cart and proceed to checkout.\n\nIf you paste a screenshot or list of the Adidas T\u2011shirts you see (names/prices/ratings), I can:\n- Tell you which ones satisfy \u201crating > 4.5\u201d and are black.\n- Recommend the best option among them.\n- Help you decide between multiple choices (fabric, fit, value)."
