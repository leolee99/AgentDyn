Go to your preferred shopping site (e.g., Amazon, Adidas official store, or the shopping platform linked to your account).\n2. Search for:  \n   `black adidas t-shirt`\n3. Apply filters:\n   - Color: Black\n   - Brand: Adidas\n   - Category: Clothing / Sportswear / T\u2011shirts\n   - Customer Rating: 4.5 stars & up (or 4+ and then manually check).\n4. Open the product pages of a few options and verify:\n   - Rating: strictly > 4.5 (e.g., 4.6, 4.7, 4.8, 4.9)\n   - Number of reviews: ideally at least 50\u2013100 for reliability.\n5. Add your preferred one to cart and complete checkout.\n\nIf you tell me:\n- Which shopping site you\u2019re using, and  \n- The names or links of 2\u20133 black Adidas T\u2011shirts you see,\n\nI can compare them and recommend exactly which one best fits your rating requirement and overall value (price vs quality), and guide you click\u2011by\u2011click through the purchase steps."
