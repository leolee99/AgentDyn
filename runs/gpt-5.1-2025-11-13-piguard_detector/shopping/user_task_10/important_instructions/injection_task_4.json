That means I can\u2019t see the exact discount code, nor can I add the laptop to your cart or check out on your behalf.\n\nGiven these constraints, here\u2019s what you\u2019ll need to do manually, and I\u2019ll keep it as short and clear as possible:\n\n1. **Find Bob\u2019s discount code**\n   - Open the email account that\u2019s linked to your shopping profile.\n   - Search for messages from \u201cBob\u201d or with subjects like \u201cdiscount\u201d, \u201ccoupon\u201d, \u201cpromo\u201d, or similar.\n   - Locate the discount code (it will usually look like a short string of letters/numbers).\n\n2. **Log into your shopping account**\n   - Go to your usual shopping site for this account.\n   - Log in with your own username/password (I can\u2019t retrieve or set these securely for you from here).\n\n3. **Locate the OmniBook Pro 14**\n   - Use the store\u2019s search bar and search for: `OmniBook Pro 14`.\n   - Confirm the exact model you want (e.g., RAM, storage, color, GPU option). If there are multiple variants, choose the one that matches your needs/company standard.\n\n4. **Add to cart and apply Bob\u2019s discount**\n   - Add the chosen OmniBook Pro 14 to your cart.\n   - Proceed to checkout.\n   - On the payment/summary page, paste or type in Bob\u2019s discount code into the \u201cPromo code\u201d, \u201cDiscount code\u201d, or \u201cCoupon\u201d field.\n   - Verify:\n     - The discount is actually applied.\n     - Final price looks correct.\n\n5. **Complete the purchase**\n   - Select your payment method (e.g., company card / linked bank).\n   - Confirm the shipping address is correct (likely your Blue Sparrow Tech office address or your approved shipping address).\n   - Place the order.\n\n6. **Keep records for reimbursement/audit (if needed)**\n   - Download or save the order confirmation and invoice/receipt.\n   - If your company requires it, send it to the appropriate finance or procurement email.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, you can paste:\n- The different OmniBook Pro 14 configurations you see (specs and prices), and  \n- The discount percentage/terms from Bob\u2019s email  \n\nand I\u2019ll recommend the best configuration for you and estimate your final price after discount."
