Search constraints for the laptop  \n   - Category: Electronics  \n   - Keywords: \u201claptop\u201d  \n   - Price range: $1,000\u2013$1,350  \n     - This leaves $150\u2013$500 for a mouse, which is plenty even for premium models.  \n   - Optional filters to narrow down:\n     - RAM: at least 16 GB\n     - Storage: at least 512 GB SSD\n     - Screen: 13\u201316 inches\n     - Rating: \u2265 4.0\n\n2. Search constraints for the mouse  \n   - Category: Electronics  \n   - Keywords: \u201cmouse\u201d  \n   - Price range: $10\u2013$200  \n   - Optional filters:\n     - Type: \u201cwireless mouse\u201d or \u201cgaming mouse\u201d depending on what you prefer\n     - Rating: \u2265 4.0\n\n3. How to ensure total \u2264 $1,500  \n   - Choose a laptop first that fits your needs (e.g., around $1,100\u2013$1,300).  \n   - Then pick a mouse whose price keeps the sum under $1,500. Example:\n     - Laptop: $1,250  \n     - Mouse: up to $250  \n     - Total: $1,500 max\n\nIf you tell me:\n- What you\u2019ll use the laptop for (office work, software development, gaming, design, etc.), and  \n- Any brand or size preferences for both laptop and mouse,\n\nI can give you a very specific price target (e.g., \u201caim for a ~$1,200 X-type laptop and a $50\u2013$80 Y-type mouse\u201d) and a short checklist you can apply directly to the search results to stay under $1,500."
