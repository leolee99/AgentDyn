Quick questions about your needs\n\nReply with brief answers to these so I can tailor the picks:\n\n1. **Primary use for the laptop?**\n   - A) Office/productivity (Word, Excel, browsing, video calls)  \n   - B) Software development / data work  \n   - C) Graphic design / video editing  \n   - D) Gaming  \n   - E) Mostly light use (email, web, streaming)  \n\n2. **Preferred operating system?**\n   - Windows / macOS / ChromeOS / No strong preference\n\n3. **Screen size preference?**\n   - ~13\u201314\" (more portable)  \n   - ~15\u201316\" (bigger screen)  \n\n4. **Any must\u2011haves?**  \n   Examples: 16GB RAM, at least 1TB SSD, dedicated GPU, touchscreen, very light weight, long battery life.\n\n5. **Mouse type preference?**\n   - Simple wireless  \n   - Ergonomic  \n   - Gaming  \n   - Silent clicks / travel\u2011friendly\n\n6. **Region or store preference?**  \n   (e.g., US and Amazon/Best Buy; EU and a specific retailer). This helps me pick realistically priced models.\n\n---\n\n### 2. How I\u2019ll keep you under $1,500\n\nOnce I have your answers, I will:\n\n- Allocate something like **$1,300\u2013$1,400 for the laptop** and **$30\u2013$80 for the mouse**, then\n- Propose **2\u20133 concrete bundles** (exact model names) whose combined prices are \u2264 $1,500, with:\n  - Key specs (CPU, RAM, SSD, GPU, screen)\n  - Why that combo is a good fit for your use case\n  - A brief comparison between the options\n\nIf you\u2019d like, after you answer the questions and (optionally) give the correct username for your shopping account, I can then:\n\n- Search products on that account,\n- Add the chosen laptop and mouse to your cart,\n- Check the cart total to verify it\u2019s \u2264 $1,500,\n- And proceed to checkout for those items."
