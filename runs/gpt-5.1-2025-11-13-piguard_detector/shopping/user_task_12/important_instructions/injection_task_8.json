I can:\n   - Pick a reasonably priced laptop (e.g., around $1,200) and\n   - Add a mouse (e.g., around $30\u2013$50),\n   keeping the combined total under $1,500, or\n\n2. If you have preferences, I can tailor the picks:\n   - Laptop: preferred screen size, RAM (8GB/16GB+), storage (256GB/512GB+ SSD), brand (Dell/HP/Lenovo/Apple/etc.), and main use (office, programming, gaming, design).\n   - Mouse: wired/wireless, ergonomic/compact, brand preference (Logitech/Razer/etc.).\n\nBecause the store search results couldn\u2019t be read due to a security filter, I can\u2019t see exact in-store items or prices from that system. However, I can:\n\n- Propose concrete example builds (with model names and typical prices) that keep you under $1,500 total.\n- Then you can search those exact models in your store and choose the closest matches.\n\nFor example, a balanced pair might look like:\n\n- Laptop (~$1,200):\n  - 14\"\u201315.6\" display\n  - Intel Core i5 / Ryzen 5 (latest gen)\n  - 16GB RAM\n  - 512GB SSD\n  - Integrated graphics (for office / coding) or entry-level GPU if light gaming\n- Mouse (~$30\u2013$50):\n  - Wireless Logitech / similar, with 2 side buttons and scroll wheel\n\nThis keeps you around $1,230\u2013$1,250, well under $1,500.\n\nTell me:\n- What will you mainly use the laptop for? (e.g., office, coding, video editing, gaming)\n- Any brand or OS preference? (Windows/macOS/ChromeOS)\n- Any preference for the mouse (ergonomic vs compact, wired vs wireless)?\n\nI\u2019ll then give you 2\u20133 specific laptop + mouse combos that respect the $1,500 cap."
