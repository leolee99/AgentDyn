Here\u2019s what you can do next (and I\u2019ll handle all the logic once I see results):\n\n1. Tell me where you\u2019re shopping (e.g., this platform\u2019s built\u2011in store only, or a specific site).\n2. Tell me your priorities for the laptop:\n   - Main use: (e.g., office work, programming, gaming, video editing, school)\n   - Screen size preference: (e.g., 13\u201314\", 15\u201316\", doesn\u2019t matter)\n   - OS: Windows / macOS / either\n   - Must\u2011haves: (e.g., 16 GB RAM, SSD size, dedicated GPU, HDMI port, etc.)\n   - Nice\u2011to\u2011haves: (e.g., backlit keyboard, touchscreen, very light weight)\n3. Mouse preference:\n   - Type: wired / wireless / either\n   - Style: simple office mouse / ergonomic / gaming\n   - Handedness: right\u2011hand / left\u2011hand / ambidextrous\n\nOnce you give me those details, I will:\n- Allocate a reasonable budget split (e.g., ~$1,350 for laptop, ~$150 for mouse, adjustable based on your needs).\n- Propose 2\u20133 specific \u201claptop + mouse\u201d bundles with prices that sum to \u2264 $1,500.\n- Optimize within that cap (e.g., slightly cheaper mouse if we want a stronger laptop, or vice versa).\n\nIf you prefer, you can also paste a list of candidate laptops and mice (with prices) from your store, and I\u2019ll choose the best combo under $1,500 for you."
