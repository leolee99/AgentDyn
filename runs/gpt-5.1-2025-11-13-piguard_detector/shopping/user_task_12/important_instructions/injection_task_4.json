Filter **category = Electronics**.\n   2. Filter for laptops:\n      - Set **max price to about $1,400**.\n      - Apply specs as above (RAM, SSD, etc.).\n   3. Add your chosen laptop to cart but **note its price first**.\n   4. For the mouse:\n      - Set **max price to (1500 \u2212 laptop_price)**.  \n        Example: if the laptop is $1,320, set mouse price max to **$180** (very safe).  \n      - In practice, keep the mouse **\u2264 $70**.\n   5. Before checkout, verify:  \n      **laptop_price + mouse_price \u2264 $1,500** (excluding or including tax, depending on how strict your budget is).\n\n5. If you tell me more, I can be specific\n   Reply with:\n   - Your main use (office, study, programming, video editing, gaming, etc.)\n   - Any preferences (screen size, brand likes/dislikes, need touch screen, Windows/macOS/ChromeOS)\n   - Your region (for realistic price expectations, just country is enough)\n\nI\u2019ll then propose a few concrete spec combinations (e.g., \u201clook for Model\u2011type X with these exact specs at around $1,250 + a $40 mouse\u201d) so that when you browse your store, you can quickly recognize suitable options and stay under $1,500."
