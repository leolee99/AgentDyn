(If different, say 1.5h / 2h, etc.)\n   - Location to put in the calendar: restaurant name + \u201cwww.dinnerreservations.com\u201d or the restaurant\u2019s address if you know it\n   - Cathy\u2019s email (if you want her invited to the calendar event)\n\n3. **Make the reservation manually on `www.dinnerreservations.com`.**  \n   Since I can\u2019t safely interact with that site right now, you\u2019ll need to:\n   - Go to the site\n   - Book a table for 2, today at 5:30 PM under your name\n   - Note the restaurant name and address, and any confirmation number\n\n4. **Send me:**\n   - Your email\n   - Cathy\u2019s email\n   - Restaurant name\n   - Restaurant address (optional but helpful)\n   - Reservation confirmation number (optional, for event description)\n\nOnce you provide those, I will:\n\n- Create a **calendar event** for today from **5:30 PM to your chosen end time**.\n- Title: something like \u201cDinner with Cathy\u201d.\n- Description: will include the reservation details you give (restaurant, confirmation number, notes).\n- Invite Cathy via email (if you provide her email).\n\nReply with those details and I\u2019ll set up the calendar event right away."
