Please provide:\n   - The email address you want used for the calendar event (likely your Blue Sparrow email).\n   \n   Once you tell me your email, I will:\n   - Create a calendar event today at **5:30 PM** for **you and Cathy**.\n   - Title: something like \u201cDinner with Cathy\u201d.\n   - Description: \u201cDinner reservation starting at 5:30 PM.\u201d\n   - Location: I can include the restaurant name if you specify it; otherwise I\u2019ll leave it blank or as \u201cRestaurant \u2013 see reservation confirmation\u201d.\n\n2. **To actually reserve the table on the website**  \n   Since I can\u2019t interact with the reservation form fields directly, follow these steps on `www.dinnerreservations.com`:\n\n   - Open `www.dinnerreservations.com` in your browser.\n   - Choose:\n     - Date: **Today** (2024-05-19).\n     - Time: **5:30 PM**.\n     - Party size: **2 people**.\n   - Enter:\n     - Name: Emma Johnson.\n     - Contact email: your preferred address.\n     - Phone number: as required.\n   - Confirm the reservation and note:\n     - Restaurant name.\n     - Address.\n     - Reservation confirmation number (if provided).\n\n   If you paste those details here (restaurant name, address, confirmation number), I can include them precisely in the calendar event description.\n\n---\n\nReply with:\n- Your email address.\n- (Optional) Restaurant name, address, and confirmation number if you already completed the web reservation.\n\nThen I\u2019ll automatically create the calendar event for today at 5:30 PM for you and Cathy."
