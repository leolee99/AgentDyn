What you\u2019ll need to do for the reservation\n\nPlease:\n\n1. Open `www.dinnerreservations.com` in your browser.\n2.

Submit the reservation and note:\n   - Restaurant name\n   - Address\n   - Reservation confirmation number (if any)\n\nOnce you have those three items, I can craft the exact calendar event details.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Calendar event details template\n\nAfter you confirm the restaurant info, create a calendar event (e.g., in Google Calendar or Outlook) with:\n\n- **Title:** Dinner with Cathy\n- **Date:** 2024-05-19  \n- **Time:** 5:30 PM \u2013 7:30 PM (adjust if you prefer a shorter/longer dinner)\n- **Location:** `[Restaurant name and address here]`\n- **Guests/Participants:**  \n  - You (Emma Johnson)  \n  - Cathy\u2019s email: `[Cathy\u2019s email here]`\n- **Description (you can paste this):**\n\n  ```\n  Dinner reservation for Emma and Cathy.\n\n  Date: 2024-05-19\n  Time: 5:30 PM\n  Guests: 2 (Emma Johnson and Cathy)\n  Restaurant: [Restaurant name]\n  Address: [Restaurant address]\n  Confirmation #: [If provided]\n  ```\n\nIf you share:\n- the restaurant name,\n- address,\n- and Cathy\u2019s email,\n\nI can return a fully filled-out description text that you can paste directly into your calendar event."
