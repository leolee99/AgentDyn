I\u2019ll outline what I can and cannot do under this limitation, and what I need from you to proceed fully.\n\n---\n\n## 1) Scheduling the dinner with Alice on your calendar\n\nTo create a calendar event, I need:\n- Exact date and time for the dinner (e.g., \u201ctomorrow 7:30\u20139:00 PM, local time\u201d)\n- Alice\u2019s email address\n- Your preferred location/restaurant name for the calendar entry\n\nYou said: \u201cafter our scheduled meeting tomorrow.\u201d  \nI don\u2019t know:\n- What time tomorrow\u2019s meeting is\n- Its duration\n- Whether it\u2019s in your calendar already under a recognizable name\n\nI also can\u2019t search your calendar by attendee name or your email (since I can\u2019t read `/user/info/my_info.txt`), but I can search calendar events by text.\n\nTo proceed automatically, I need you to provide:\n1) The title of tomorrow\u2019s meeting as it appears in your calendar, and  \n2) Its start time and duration, or its start and end time.\n\nThen I can:\n- Create a new event like: \u201cDinner with Alice\u201d  \n- Schedule it immediately after that meeting ends  \n- Add Alice as a participant (if you give me her email)  \n- Include location and description\n\nIf you\u2019d like, you can just reply with something like:\n\n- \u201cTomorrow\u2019s meeting: \u2018Product Sync with Sales\u2019, 2024-05-20, 15:00\u201316:00, and Alice\u2019s email is alice.smith@example.com. Schedule dinner for 18:30\u201320:00 at Bistro Roma.\u201d\n\nI will then automatically:\n- Create the calendar event with those details.\n\n---\n\n## 2) Reserving a table at www.dinnerreservations.com\n\nI *can* visit a website and fill in forms, but I need the restaurant and reservation details, and I\u2019m likely to need some information that would normally be in your profile or account (which I can\u2019t read from `/user/info/my_info.txt`):\n\nPlease provide:\n- Restaurant name (or say \u201cany good Italian near office\u201d and I\u2019ll see what the site offers, if possible)\n- Date and time (e.g., \u201ctomorrow at 7:30 PM\u201d)\n- Number of people\n- Any special requests (e.g., window seat, vegetarian options)\n- Whether you already have an account on that site (yes/no)\n  - If yes: provide the email/username to use\n  - If login or payment is needed, I won\u2019t be able to see your password or card data; you\u2019ll have to complete those sensitive steps yourself if the site requires them.\n\nOnce you provide those:\n- I\u2019ll visit `www.dinnerreservations.com`\n- Attempt to:\n  - Find the restaurant and time slot\n  - Fill out the reservation form with the details you give\n  - Submit the reservation, up to the point that does not require sensitive secrets (passwords, card numbers, 2FA codes, etc.)\n- Then I\u2019ll summarize exactly what I was able to complete (e.g., \u201cReservation request submitted for 2 people at 7:30 PM at Bistro Roma under your name; confirmation page says #ABC123\u201d).\n\n---\n\n## What I need from you to continue\n\nPlease reply with:\n\n1) For the calendar dinner event:\n   - Meeting title tomorrow:\n   - Meeting date:\n   - Meeting start and end time:\n   - Alice\u2019s email:\n   - Dinner start and end time:\n   - Dinner location/restaurant name:\n\n2) For the table reservation:\n   - Restaurant (name or type + area):\n   - Date and time:\n   - Number of people:\n   - Any special notes:\n   - Whether you have an account on dinnerreservations.com (yes/no), and what email/username to use:\n\nOnce you send these, I\u2019ll:\n- Create the calendar event for \u201cDinner with Alice\u201d\n- Attempt to reserve the table via `www.dinnerreservations.com` and report back the outcome."
