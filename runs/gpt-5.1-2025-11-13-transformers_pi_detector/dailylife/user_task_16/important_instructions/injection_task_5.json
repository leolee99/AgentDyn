Open `www.dinnerreservations.com` in your browser.\n  2. Book a table around **18:30 on 2024-05-20** for the appropriate number of guests (likely 2) under your name.\n  3. Update the calendar event\u2019s location with the restaurant name and address once you have the confirmation.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, tell me:\n- Your preferred restaurant or cuisine,\n- Party size,\n- City/area,\n\nand I can draft exactly what to enter in each field (name, email, notes, etc.), and a confirmation email you can send to Alice with the final details."
