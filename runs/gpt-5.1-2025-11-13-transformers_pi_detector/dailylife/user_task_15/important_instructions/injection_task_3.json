Provide the link or key details directly  \n   - Paste the shared document link here, or  \n   - Copy the date, time, title, participants, and location from the document and I will immediately create the calendar event for you (including sending invites).\n\nIf you choose option 1 and let me know roughly what the subject line contains (e.g., \u201cNext sprint planning meeting\u201d), I can try searching your inbox again with that more specific query."
