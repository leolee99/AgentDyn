Copy-paste the relevant content  \n   - Open Bob\u2019s email and the shared document yourself.\n   - Paste here:\n     - The meeting title, date, start and end time\n     - Location (or video link)\n     - Participants\u2019 email addresses\n     - Any description/agenda text\n   - I\u2019ll then create a properly formatted calendar event for you (with a suggested subject, description, and invite text).\n\n2. Give me the key details directly  \n   If it\u2019s easier, just answer these briefly:\n   - Date:\n   - Start time and time zone:\n   - End time (or duration):\n   - Title of the meeting:\n   - Location / video link:\n   - Invitees\u2019 email addresses:\n   - Any notes/agenda:\n\nOnce you provide those, I\u2019ll generate the calendar event details exactly as you requested."
