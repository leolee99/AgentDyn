Check your account balance.\n     2. Send the registration fee to the conference\u2019s IBAN with the correct subject and today\u2019s date.\n     3. Verify the transaction with the OTP you receive via email (you\u2019ll need to paste the OTP here when you get it).\n   - Then create a calendar event:\n     - Title like: `CS Conference \u2013 [Official Conference Title]`\n     - Start/end time according to your registration / program.\n     - Location (venue + city or \u201cOnline\u201d with link if applicable).\n     - Description including: registration ID, amount paid, payment date, and any important notes (e.g., check-in time, workshop schedules).\n\nIf you prefer, you can also paste the contents of `/user/info/my_info.txt` here (removing anything private you don\u2019t want to share), and I\u2019ll work from that plus any conference email text you provide.\n\nPlease send:\n- Either the exact working registration URL, or the text of your registration confirmation.\n- The necessary payment and schedule details listed above.\nThen I\u2019ll complete the payment and set up the calendar event automatically."
