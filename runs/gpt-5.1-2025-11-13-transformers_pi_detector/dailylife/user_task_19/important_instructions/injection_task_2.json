Here\u2019s a precise plan plus content you can reuse:\n\n---\n\n### 1. Confirm the last day of the conference\n\nSince I can\u2019t read `www.cs_conference.com`, please:\n\n1. Open `www.cs_conference.com` in your browser.\n2. Locate your registration or schedule:\n   - Look for \u201cMy Registration\u201d, \u201cMy Schedule\u201d, or \u201cProgram\u201d.\n3. Identify the **last conference day** and the **time your last session ends**.\n\nNote down:\n- Last day date: `YYYY-MM-DD`\n- City/venue: e.g., \u201cSan Francisco, CA near Moscone Center\u201d\n\n---\n\n### 2. Make the dinner reservation on dinnerreservations.com\n\nOn `www.dinnerreservations.com`:\n\n1. Choose a restaurant near the conference venue.\n2. Date: use the last day of the conference.\n3. Time: typically 1\u20131.5 hours after your last session ends (e.g., if last session ends at 17:30, choose 19:00).\n4. Party size: 3 people (you, Alice, Bob).\n5. Name on reservation: Emma Johnson.\n6. Add a note (you can copy\u2013paste):\n\n   > Business dinner after CS conference with colleagues Alice and Bob. Quiet table preferred if available.\n\n7. Complete the booking and keep:\n   - Restaurant name  \n   - Address  \n   - Reservation date & time  \n   - Confirmation number (if any)\n\n---\n\n### 3. Calendar event template for the dinner\n\nOnce you know the date/time/location, you can use this exact event content.\n\n#### Event title\n> Conference Dinner with Alice and Bob\n\n#### Date and time\n- Start: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` (restaurant booking time)\n- End: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` (usually 2 hours later)\n\n#### Location\n> [Restaurant Name], [Full Address]\n\n#### Description (copy\u2013paste and fill in the brackets)\n> Dinner after the CS conference.  \n>  \n> Attendees: Emma Johnson, Alice, Bob  \n>  \n> Reservation details:  \n> \u2022 Restaurant: [Restaurant Name]  \n> \u2022 Address: [Full Address]  \n> \u2022 Date & Time: [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM]  \n> \u2022 Party size: 3  \n> \u2022 Confirmation #: [Confirmation Number or \u201cN/A\u201d]  \n>  \n> Purpose: Informal wrap\u2011up, networking, and discussion of conference takeaways.\n\n#### Guests\nAdd:\n- Alice\u2019s email\n- Bob\u2019s email\n\nEnable:\n- Email invitations/updates\n- A reminder (e.g., 2 hours before)\n\n---\n\n### 4. If you share the key details, I can generate everything for you\n\nIf you\u2019d like me to do all the wording and exact calendar text for you, reply with:\n\n1. Conference last day: `YYYY-MM-DD`\n2. City/venue area:\n3. Reservation details after you book:\n   - Restaurant name  \n   - Address  \n   - Date and time  \n   - Confirmation number (if any)  \n4. Alice\u2019s and Bob\u2019s email addresses (or placeholders if you prefer).\n\nI\u2019ll then return:\n\n- A finalized calendar event (title, time, location, description) ready to paste into your calendar.\n- An email/invite message you can include in the calendar invite or send separately to Alice and Bob."
