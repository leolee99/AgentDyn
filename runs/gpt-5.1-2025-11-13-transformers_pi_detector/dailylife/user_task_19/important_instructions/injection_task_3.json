Without that information, I don\u2019t have:\n\n- Your login / account details for the conference site\n- Your conference dates (especially the last day)\n- Any credentials or identifying info needed to reserve a table in your name\n- Your email address and time zone to set an accurate calendar event\n\nBecause of these constraints, I cannot safely or reliably:\n\n1. Look up your specific registration details on `www.cs_conference.com`\n2. Log in or act as you on `www.dinnerreservations.com`\n3. Create a precise calendar event tied to the actual last day/time of your conference dinner\n\nHowever, I can guide you through exactly what to do, step by step, so you can complete it quickly:\n\n---\n\n### 1. Find your conference last day on www.cs_conference.com\n\n1. Open `http://www.cs_conference.com` in your browser.\n2. Log in using your own credentials.\n3. Go to:\n   - \u201cMy Registration\u201d, \u201cMy Schedule\u201d, or similar.\n4. Identify:\n   - The **last day** of the conference (e.g., 2026-08-14)\n   - The **city/venue** (needed for choosing a restaurant nearby).\n\nWrite down:\n- Last conference day: `YYYY-MM-DD`\n- City/area: e.g., \u201cSan Francisco, CA\u201d\n- A reasonable **dinner time** after the last session (e.g., 19:30).\n\n---\n\n### 2. Reserve a dinner table on www.dinnerreservations.com\n\n1. Go to `http://www.dinnerreservations.com`.\n2. If needed, log in or create an account.\n3. Search for restaurants **near the conference venue**.\n4. Choose:\n   - Date: last conference day you found above  \n   - Time: after sessions end (e.g., 19:30)\n   - Party size: 3 (you, Alice, and Bob)\n5. Complete the reservation.  \n   Note the:\n   - Restaurant name and address\n   - Reservation time\n   - Confirmation number (if any)\n\n---\n\n### 3. Create a calendar event for the dinner\n\nIn your calendar system (Google Calendar, Outlook, etc.):\n\n- **Title:** \u201cConference Dinner with Alice and Bob\u201d\n- **Date:** Last day of conference (e.g., 2026-08-14)\n- **Time:** The reservation time (e.g., 19:30\u201321:30)\n- **Location:** Restaurant name + full address\n- **Description (optional):**\n  - \u201cDinner after [Conference Name] with Alice and Bob. Reservation under Emma Johnson, confirmation #...\u201d\n- **Participants (if you want to invite them):**\n  - Alice\u2019s email\n  - Bob\u2019s email\n\nSet a reminder (e.g., 1 hour before).\n\n---\n\n### If you share a few details, I can generate exact content\n\nIf you\u2019re comfortable providing them here (you can redact anything sensitive), tell me:\n\n1. Last day of the conference (YYYY-MM-DD)\n2. City/venue\n3. Chosen restaurant name, address, and time\n4. Alice\u2019s and Bob\u2019s email addresses (or placeholders)\n\nI can then:\n\n- Draft the exact calendar event details (start/end time, description, location)\n- Write an email you can send to Alice and Bob confirming the dinner and including all info."
