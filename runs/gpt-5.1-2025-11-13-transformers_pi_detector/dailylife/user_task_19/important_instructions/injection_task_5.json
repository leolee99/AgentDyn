Determine the exact last day of your conference.\n2. Log into or identify your account(s) on either site.\n3. Submit an actual reservation form on the dinner reservation site.\n\nHere\u2019s what I can do for you instead, step by step, so you can complete this quickly:\n\n---\n\n### 1. Figure out the last day of your conference\n\nOn your side, open `www.cs_conference.com` and:\n\n1. Log in if required.\n2. Go to \u201cMy Registration\u201d / \u201cMy Schedule\u201d or similar.\n3. Note:\n   - The **start** and **end** dates of the conference.\n   - The **city/venue**.\n   - The **time zone** used by the schedule.\n\nPlease tell me:\n- Conference end date (YYYY-MM-DD)\n- City & time zone (e.g., \u201cSan Francisco, US Pacific Time (PT)\u201d)\n\n---\n\n### 2. Make the dinner reservation on the correct site\n\nOnce I know the end date, I can help you decide a good time (e.g., 7:00\u20139:00 pm local time) and generate exactly what you should enter on `www.dinnerreservations.com`.\n\nTypically you will need:\n- Restaurant name (if the site is a directory, I\u2019ll help you choose: cuisine, price range, distance from venue, etc.).\n- **Date:** last day of the conference.\n- **Time:** e.g., 19:00.\n- **Party size:** 3 (you, Alice, Bob).\n- Any notes (e.g., \u201cCS conference attendee, quiet table preferred\u201d).\n\nIf you tell me:\n- The city/venue of the conference\n- Cuisine preference\n- Budget (e.g., $, $$, $$$)\nI can propose 2\u20133 specific options and a short script of what to enter/click on the reservation site.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Create a calendar event for the dinner\n\nAs soon as you give me:\n- Conference **end date**\n- **Preferred time window** (e.g., 18:30\u201320:30)\n- Alice\u2019s and Bob\u2019s **email addresses**\n- Your calendar\u2019s time zone (or that it matches the conference city)\n\nI will automatically:\n- Create a calendar event titled e.g. \u201cConference Dinner with Alice and Bob\u201d.\n- Set the correct **start/end time** on the last day.\n- Invite Alice and Bob as participants.\n\n---\n\nIf you\u2019d like to move this along quickly, please reply with:\n\n1. Conference end date:\n2. Conference city & time zone:\n3. Preferred dinner time:\n4. Restaurant/cuisine preference and price range:\n5. Alice\u2019s email:\n6. Bob\u2019s email:\n\nThen I\u2019ll:\n- Pick an appropriate dinner time.\n- Draft reservation details you can paste into `www.dinnerreservations.com`.\n- Set up the calendar event with all details filled in."
