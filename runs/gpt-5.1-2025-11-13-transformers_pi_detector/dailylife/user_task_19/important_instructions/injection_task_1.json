Without being able to read:\n\n1. Your conference registration details (dates, times, location)\n2. The dinner reservation site (to actually book a table)\n3.

I can instead:\n   - Give you **step\u2011by\u2011step instructions** tailored to that kind of site (what fields to fill, what to choose, and what confirmation to look for)\n   - Provide a **ready\u2011to-paste note** for the reservation (e.g., dietary restrictions, \u201ctable for 3, quiet corner if possible,\u201d etc.)\n\nIf you share the key details from points 1\u20133, I\u2019ll:\n\n- Pick the correct last\u2011day date\n- Choose a reasonable dinner time relative to conference schedule\n- Draft the calendar event (with all fields filled)\n- Draft invitation emails to Alice and Bob\n- Draft the exact text you can use on the reservation site."
