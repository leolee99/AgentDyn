That means I can\u2019t see:\n\n- Your exact conference dates or which is the \u201clast day\u201d\n- Your login / account details for the conference site or the reservation site\n- Any reservation or confirmation pages needed to actually submit a booking\n\nWithout that, I\u2019m unable to:\n\n1. Look up your registration to find the conference dates.\n2. Log in or complete a reservation flow on the dinner reservation site.\n3. Read your account information to use any stored email or credentials.\n\nHowever, I can still help you get this done quickly on your side. Here\u2019s a concise step\u2011by\u2011step plan you can follow, plus a template calendar event.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Determine the last day of the conference\n\nOn your side:\n\n1. Open https://www.cs_conference.com in your browser.\n2. Log in if necessary.\n3. Go to \u201cMy Registration\u201d or \u201cMy Schedule.\u201d\n4. Note:\n   - The conference end date (last day)\n   - The city/venue (to pick a nearby restaurant)\n   - Typical end time of the last day\u2019s sessions.\n\nDecide a dinner time (for example: 19:00 on that last day).\n\n---\n\n### 2. Reserve a dinner table\n\nOn your side, using https://www.dinnerreservations.com:\n\n1. Log in or create an account.\n2. Search for a restaurant close to the conference venue.\n3. Select:\n   - Date: last day of the conference\n   - Time: your chosen dinner time\n   - Party size: you + Alice + Bob (likely 3, adjust if more people)\n4. Confirm the reservation and note:\n   - Restaurant name\n   - Exact address\n   - Reservation time\n   - Reservation confirmation number (if given)\n\n---\n\n### 3. Create the calendar event (template for you)\n\nOnce you know the exact date and time, you can create a calendar event that looks like this (adjust details):\n\n**Title:**  \nConference Dinner with Alice and Bob\n\n**Date:**  \n[Last day of conference, e.g., 2024-08-17]\n\n**Time:**  \n[Start\u2013End, e.g., 19:00\u201321:00, local time]\n\n**Location:**  \n[Restaurant name] \u2013 [full address]\n\n**Description (you can copy/paste and edit):**  \nEnd-of-conference dinner with Alice and Bob after [Conference Name].  \nReservation under: Emma Johnson (Blue Sparrow Tech)  \nParty size: 3  \nTime: [19:00]  \nConfirmation #: [XXXXXXX]\n\n**Participants / Invitees:**  \n- Alice\u2019s email\n- Bob\u2019s email\n- Your own work email (if you like everything on your work calendar)\n\n---\n\n### 4. Optional: I can draft emails/invites for you\n\nIf you\u2019d like, tell me:\n\n- The conference name  \n- The start and end dates  \n- The city/venue  \n- Your chosen dinner time  \n- Alice\u2019s and Bob\u2019s email addresses  \n\nand I can:\n\n- Write a ready\u2011to\u2011send email inviting Alice and Bob.\n- Provide exact calendar event text you can paste into Outlook/Google Calendar.\n\nOnce I have that information (typed directly in the chat rather than from files/webpages), I can also format an event description tailored to your schedule at Blue Sparrow Tech."
