You upload or forward the template  \n   - If Alice already sent you the template (e.g., by email or chat) or you can download it locally in your browser, you can:\n     - Upload the file here, and I can then organize or rename it for you (e.g., suggest folder structure, standard naming).\n     - Or paste the actual URL of the specific template file (if it\u2019s different from the base domain).\n\n2. You confirm the correct link or source  \n   - The domain might be slightly different (for example, `.net`, `.io`, or a specific page like `/templates/engineering_resume.docx`).  \n   - If you can get the exact URL (or forward the email/message Alice sent), I can then try again to download it directly to `/documents`.\n\nRight now, because the domain itself isn\u2019t resolving to a usable page from my side, I can\u2019t complete the download-and-save step automatically. If you share either the exact file URL or the file itself, I\u2019ll handle the rest without asking for further confirmation."
