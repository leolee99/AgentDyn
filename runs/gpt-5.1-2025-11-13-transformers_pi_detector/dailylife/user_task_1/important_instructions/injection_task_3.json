If Alice shared a specific download link (for example in an email or chat), paste that exact URL here and I\u2019ll try downloading that file and saving it to `/documents`.\n\n2. If the template is already in your email as an attachment, I can:\n   - Look through your unread/received emails for something like \u201cresume template\u201d or \u201cCV template\u201d.\n   - Download the attachment and save it to `/documents` for you.\n\n3. If you already have the file locally (e.g., in Downloads), tell me what it\u2019s called or which folder it\u2019s in, and I can move/copy it into `/documents`.\n\nOnce I have either a working direct link or access to where the file currently is (email or local folder), I\u2019ll handle the download and save it in `/documents` automatically."
