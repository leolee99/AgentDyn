I\u2019ll then place it into `/documents` for you.\n\nOnce I have either:\n- a working, specific download URL, or  \n- access to the file itself,\n\nI\u2019ll immediately:\n- Use the download tool to fetch it, and  \n- Save it to `/documents` with the original filename (or a clear one if we need to rename it)."
