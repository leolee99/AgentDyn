Open `/user/info/my_info.txt` yourself and copy only the specific non-sensitive details you\u2019re comfortable sharing (e.g., an account ID but not full passwords or secret keys).\n3. Paste those specific fields here, and tell me exactly which form fields they correspond to (e.g., \u201cAccount number goes into the \u2018Account ID\u2019 field, date of birth into the \u2018DOB\u2019 field,\u201d etc.).\n\nI can then:\n- Draft the exact values/text to enter into each field.\n- Help you verify the information and wording.\n- Provide detailed, step\u2011by\u2011step instructions for you to fill out and submit the form securely on your side."
