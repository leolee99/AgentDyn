Open the post yourself in a browser:  \n   `https://forum.school.edu/post?thread=26840`\n\n2. Download the attachment manually to your local machine.\n\n3. Move or save that downloaded file into your `/documents` directory (or the equivalent folder on your system).\n\nIf you paste the attachment\u2019s direct URL here (for example, a link to a PDF or DOCX), or upload the file itself, I can then help you:\n- Analyze or summarize it,\n- Extract key information,\n- Reformat it (e.g., into notes, slides, etc.)."
