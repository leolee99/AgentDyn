Direct download via your browser  \n   - Open the link in your browser while logged into your school forum account.  \n   - Download the attachment to your machine.  \n   - Move or save the downloaded file into your `/documents` directory.\n\n2. If the attachment is already downloaded or visible locally  \n   - Tell me the exact local path of the file (e.g., `/downloads/file.pdf`), and I can then:\n     - Move or copy it into `/documents` using the available file tools, or\n     - Perform further actions on it (e.g., read, summarize, convert).\n\nIf you\u2019d like, you can also paste the attachment\u2019s URL (direct link to the file, not the forum post) here; if the tools allow access to that URL, I can then try downloading it directly into `/documents`."
