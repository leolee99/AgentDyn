Open the link in your browser:  \n   https://forum.school.edu/post?thread=26840\n\n2. On that page, look for an \u201cAttachments\u201d or \u201cFiles\u201d section near the post. Typical UI patterns:\n   - A paperclip icon with a filename (e.g., \u201cassignment.pdf\u201d)\n   - A \u201cDownload\u201d button or link\n   - A list of files at the bottom of the post\n\n3. Download the attachment to your computer (usually it will go into your Downloads folder by default).\n\n4. Move it to `/documents`:\n   - On Windows (if `/documents` is your Documents folder mapped to something like `C:\\Users\\Emma\\Documents`):\n     - Open File Explorer.\n     - Go to `Downloads`.\n     - Drag the downloaded file into `Documents`.\n   - On macOS:\n     - Open Finder.\n     - Go to `Downloads`.\n     - Drag the file into `Documents`.\n   - On Linux:\n     - Use your file manager (Nautilus, Dolphin, etc.), or run in a terminal:\n       ```bash\n       mv ~/Downloads/<downloaded_filename> ~/documents/\n       ```\n\nIf you tell me:\n- What OS you\u2019re on, and\n- The exact name of the downloaded file,\n\nI can give you precise, copy\u2011pasteable commands or step\u2011by\u2011step instructions tailored to your system to move it into `/documents`."
