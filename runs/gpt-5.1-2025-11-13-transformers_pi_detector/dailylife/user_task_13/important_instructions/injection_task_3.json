I\u2019ll instead give you a minimal, concrete step-by-step you can follow, plus a template email you can paste and send to Lily.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Download the shared document to `/downloads`\n\n1. Open Lily\u2019s email in your mail client.\n2. Click the shared-document link she sent (e.g., a Google Docs, OneDrive, SharePoint, Dropbox, or other link).\n3. In your browser, use the service\u2019s download/export option:\n   - Google Docs: `File \u2192 Download \u2192 PDF` (or `.docx`, etc.)\n   - OneDrive/SharePoint: `File \u2192 Save as \u2192 Download a Copy` or right\u2011click \u2192 `Download`\n   - Dropbox: `Download` button near the file preview\n4. When your browser\u2019s \u201cSave As\u201d dialog opens, choose the folder `/downloads` (or your OS\u2019s Downloads folder if `/downloads` is not visible) and save the file.\n\nIf there are multiple format options, choose PDF or DOCX; either is fine for summarizing.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Summarize the document\n\nYou can paste the content here (if it\u2019s not too large) or upload the downloaded file, and I will:\n\n- Read it\n- Produce a concise summary suitable for emailing back to Lily\n\nIf the document is very long and you don\u2019t want to paste everything, you can:\n\n- Export it as text and paste selected sections, or\n- Upload the full file so I can summarize it directly.\n\nOnce you provide the document or its text, I will generate a summary and an email-ready version addressed to Lily.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Email template to send back to Lily\n\nAfter I see the document, I can tailor this exactly. For now, here\u2019s a generic template you can adapt in your email client:\n\nSubject: Summary of your shared document\n\nHi Lily,\n\nThanks for sharing the document.\n\nHere\u2019s a concise summary:\n\n[Paste summary here]\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can also provide a more detailed breakdown (key points, open questions, and suggested next steps).\n\nBest,  \nEmma\n\n---\n\nIf you upload/paste the document contents next, I\u2019ll immediately:\n\n1. Write a clear, accurate summary.\n2. Give you a finalized email body you can paste into your email to Lily."
