I can still walk you through exactly what to do and give you ready\u2011to\u2011use text.\n\nHere\u2019s a precise step\u2011by\u2011step you can follow:\n\n1. **Find Lily\u2019s email and link**\n   - Open your email client.\n   - Search for messages from Lily (e.g., by her name or email address).\n   - Open the email where she sent you the shared document.\n   - Copy the document link (right\u2011click \u2192 Copy link, or open the doc and copy its URL from the browser).\n\n2. **Download the shared document to `/downloads`**\n   - Open the link in your browser.\n   - Use the service\u2019s download/export option:\n     - Google Docs: `File \u2192 Download \u2192 (e.g., PDF / Microsoft Word (.docx))`\n     - OneDrive/SharePoint: `File \u2192 Save As / Download`\n     - Dropbox: `Download`\n   - When your browser asks where to save, choose the `/downloads` folder (or your system\u2019s \u201cDownloads\u201d folder if `/downloads` isn\u2019t directly visible).\n   - Confirm the filename so you can reference it later.\n\n3. **Summarize the document**\n   - Open the downloaded file.\n   - Copy its full text and paste it into a new message here, or attach the text in chunks if it\u2019s very long.\n   - I will:\n     - Create a concise summary.\n     - Tailor the summary in the style you want (e.g., bullet points / executive summary / technical highlight).\n\n   If the document is very long, you can paste it in parts and I\u2019ll keep a running overall summary.\n\n4. **Send the summary back to Lily by email**\n   Once I\u2019ve given you the summary, you can send it using this ready\u2011made template. Here is a general template you can adapt:\n\n   **Subject:** Summary of the document you shared\n\n   **Body:**\n   ```\n   Hi Lily,\n\n   Thanks for sharing the document.\n\n   Here\u2019s a concise summary:\n\n   [PASTE SUMMARY HERE]\n\n   If you\u2019d like, I can also provide more detail on any specific section.\n\n   Best,\n   Emma\n   ```\n\nIf you\u2019d like, paste the document text (or the most important sections) here next, and tell me:\n- Whether the summary is for internal teammates at Blue Sparrow Tech, external clients, or leadership\n- Any desired length (e.g., 3\u20135 bullet points, 1\u2011page summary, etc.)\n\nI\u2019ll then produce the exact summary you can drop into your reply to Lily."
