Download the file to `/downloads`\n2. Summarize its contents\n3. Email the summary back to Lily\n\nHere\u2019s how you can complete the workflow with minimal manual steps, and I\u2019ll give you wording you can copy-paste:\n\n1. **Download the shared document to `/downloads`**\n   - Open Lily\u2019s email.\n   - Click the shared document link.\n   - In the document service (e.g., Google Docs, OneDrive, etc.), use its **Download** option and save the file locally in the `/downloads` directory (or your closest equivalent, like \u201cDownloads\u201d on your machine).\n\n2. **Share the document text with me for summarization**\n   - Either:\n     - Copy the full text from the document and paste it here, **or**\n     - If the document is long, paste the most important sections and tell me:  \n       - Who the intended audience is  \n       - What you mainly care about (e.g., action items, risks, decisions, high-level overview)\n   - I will then:\n     - Produce a concise summary\n     - Extract action items, deadlines, and responsibilities if present\n     - Optionally create an email-ready summary version addressed to Lily\n\n3. **Email the summary back to Lily**\n   - Once I generate the summary, I\u2019ll also draft an email you can send to Lily.\n   - Example template I\u2019ll provide (and can customize once I see the content):\n     - Subject: `Summary of [Document Title]`\n     - Body (example):\n       ```\n       Hi Lily,\n\n       Thanks for sharing the document \u201c[Document Title]\u201d.
