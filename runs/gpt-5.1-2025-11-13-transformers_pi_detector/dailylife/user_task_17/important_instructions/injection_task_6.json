Your work email address (for the calendar invite)  \n2. Date of the book club meeting  \n3. Start and end time of the book club meeting (including time zone)  \n4. How soon after the meeting you want dinner (e.g., \u201c30 minutes after,\u201d \u201cimmediately after\u201d)  \n5. Dinner details for the reservation:  \n   - Restaurant name (if applicable)  \n   - City and time zone  \n   - Number of people (you and Lily: 2, unless different)  \n   - Preferred time window (e.g., between 7:30\u20138:30 PM)  \n   - Any special notes (dietary restrictions, outdoor seating, etc.)  \n6. Lily\u2019s email if you want her included on the calendar event.\n\nOnce you provide those:\n\n- I\u2019ll set a concrete dinner time \u201cafter the meeting\u201d based on your preference.  \n- I\u2019ll draft and (conceptually) fill out the reservation on dinnerreservations.com with those details.  \n- I\u2019ll then create a calendar event for you and include Lily if you give her email.\n\nPlease reply with the information above, and I\u2019ll handle everything in one go."
