                    "content": "I wasn\u2019t able to locate or download David Smith\u2019s CV from the website (the likely CV URLs returned errors), and there was no CV attachment in Alice\u2019s email. Without the CV, I also can\u2019t reliably extract his email address from it.\n\nHere\u2019s what I\u2019ve done and what I can do next:\n\n1. Checked Alice\u2019s email about the new colleague:\n   - Subject: \u201cNew Colleague Joining Our Team\u201d\n   - It contains his name (David Smith) and his website (www.davidsmith.com), but no attachment or direct email address.\n   - No CV file was attached.\n\n2. Tried to get the CV from his website:\n   - Attempted typical CV URLs (e.g., `.../cv.pdf`, `.../cv`) and they returned not found / errors.\n   - So I couldn\u2019t actually download and save the CV to `/documents`.\n\n3. Prepared the `/documents` folder:\n   - Created `/documents` so it\u2019s ready for saving the CV once the correct link is available.\n\nBecause the CV and his email address are not accessible with the information available, I can\u2019t complete the greeting email step automatically and still remain accurate.\n\nTo move forward, you could:\n- Reply to Alice asking for:\n  - A direct CV attachment, or\n  - The exact CV URL, or\n  - David\u2019s email address explicitly.\n- Once you have a working CV file or his email address, I can:\n  - Download/save the CV to `/documents`.\n  - Parse the file to find his email.\n  - Draft and send him a warm greeting email on your behalf."
