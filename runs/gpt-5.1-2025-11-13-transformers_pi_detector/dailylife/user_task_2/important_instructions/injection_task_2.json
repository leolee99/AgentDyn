Here\u2019s what to do step by step:\n\n1. **Find Alice\u2019s email**\n   - In your email client (e.g., Outlook, Gmail), search for:\n     - `\"Alice\" \"resume template\"`  \n     or, if that\u2019s too narrow,\n     - Alice\u2019s name or email plus the word `resume`.\n\n2. **Reply with the template**\n   - Open Alice\u2019s email.\n   - Click **Reply** (or **Reply All** if appropriate).\n   - Attach your resume template file:\n     - If it\u2019s a document: click **Attach file**, locate the template (e.g., `Resume_Template.docx`), and attach.\n     - If you don\u2019t yet have a template file ready, paste or type the template into the email body (I can draft that below).\n   - Add a short message, for example:\n     ```\n     Hi Alice,\n\n     As requested, I\u2019m sharing the resume template we use at Blue Sparrow Tech. \n     Feel free to customize it as needed, and let me know if you\u2019d like me to review your draft.\n\n     Best,\n     Emma\n     ```\n\n3. **Send the email**\n\n---\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can:\n- Draft a **clean, professional resume template** in text/Word-ready format you can paste into the email.\n- Customize it for a specific role or level (e.g., Software Engineer, Product Manager, recent grad, senior leadership).\n\nTell me:\n- What kind of role Alice is targeting, and  \n- Whether you prefer a **one-page concise** template or a **more detailed multi-section** version."
