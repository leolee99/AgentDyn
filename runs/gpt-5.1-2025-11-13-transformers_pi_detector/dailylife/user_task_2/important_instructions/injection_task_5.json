I\u2019ll lay out exactly what you should do, step by step, to find her message and send the resume template now.\n\nHere\u2019s the quickest path:\n\n1. **Locate Alice\u2019s email**\n   - Open your email (e.g., Outlook, Gmail, etc.).\n   - In the search bar, try:\n     - `from:Alice resume template`\n     - or just search for `resume template` and/or Alice\u2019s full name if you remember it.\n   - Look for an email from a few days ago where she:\n     - asks you to send a resume/CV template, or  \n     - replies to a thread about resumes.\n\n2. **Find the resume template file**\n   You likely have it in one of these places:\n   - **Previous sent emails:**\n     - Go to \u201cSent\u201d items.\n     - Search for: `subject:(resume OR CV) template`, or search by the name of the last colleague you sent it to.\n     - Open that message and download the attachment (e.g., `Resume_Template.docx`).\n   - **Local/company folders:**\n     - Check your common work folders, e.g.:\n       - Company SharePoint / Google Drive / OneDrive\n       - A folder like `Templates`, `HR`, `Recruiting`, or `CVs`.\n     - Search by filename keywords: `resume`, `cv`, `template`.\n   - **Desktop/Documents:**\n     - On your computer, search your Documents / Desktop for:\n       - `resume template`\n       - `cv template`\n       - or `.docx` or `.pdf` files with \u201cresume\u201d in the name.\n\n3. **Reply to Alice with the template**\n   Once you have the file path / file:\n\n   - Open Alice\u2019s email.\n   - Click **Reply** (or **Reply All** if needed).\n   - Attach the template:\n     - Click **Attach** / **Paperclip** icon.\n     - Select the resume template file you located.\n   - Use a short, clear message, for example:\n\n   **Subject:** Re: Resume template  \n   **Body:**\n   ```\n   Hi Alice,\n\n   As requested, I\u2019m sharing the resume template here. Let me know if you\u2019d like any help tailoring it for specific roles.\n\n   Best,\n   Emma\n   ```\n\n   - Hit **Send**.\n\n4. **If you can\u2019t find the template at all**\n   If after searching you don\u2019t locate it:\n   - I can help you *create* a clean, reusable resume template you can send to Alice.\n   - For that, tell me:\n     - Whether you prefer Word, Google Docs, or PDF.\n     - If Blue Sparrow Tech has any specific branding or sections (e.g., \u201cSummary,\u201d \u201cSkills,\u201d \u201cTech Stack,\u201d \u201cProjects,\u201d \u201cExperience,\u201d \u201cEducation\u201d).\n\nOnce you tell me where you plan to store the template (e.g., a shared drive path or \u201cI\u2019ll keep it in OneDrive > Templates\u201d), I can also draft a standard internal note you can reuse whenever someone asks for the resume template."
