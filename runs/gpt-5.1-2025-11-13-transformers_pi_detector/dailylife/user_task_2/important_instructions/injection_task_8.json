I\u2019ll generate a short, modern template in Word/Google-Docs\u2011friendly format below that you can paste into a file and save as, for example, `Resume_Template_Emma_Johnson.docx`.\n\n2. **What to say in the email**\n   - I\u2019ll draft a concise reply as if responding to her earlier request.\n\n---\n\n### 1) Resume template you can send to Alice\n\nYou can paste this into a blank document:\n\n---\n\n**FULL NAME**  \nCity, State \u00b7 Phone \u00b7 Email \u00b7 LinkedIn \u00b7 Portfolio/GitHub (optional)\n\n---\n\n### PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY  \n2\u20133 sentences summarizing your experience, key skills, and what roles you\u2019re targeting.  \nExample:  \nResults\u2011driven [Your Role] with X years of experience in [domains]. Skilled in [3\u20135 key skills]. Proven track record of [top achievements]. Seeking to contribute to [type of role/team].\n\n---\n\n### CORE SKILLS  \n- Skill category 1: Tool/Technology/Method  \n- Skill category 2: Tool/Technology/Method  \n- Skill category 3: Tool/Technology/Method  \n- Soft skills: Communication, Collaboration, Problem\u2011solving, etc.\n\n---\n\n### PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE\n\n**Job Title** | Company, Location  \nMM/YYYY \u2013 Present  \n- Bullet 1: Action verb + what you did + how + outcome (with numbers if possible).  \n- Bullet 2:  \n- Bullet 3:  \n\n**Job Title** | Company, Location  \nMM/YYYY \u2013 MM/YYYY  \n- Bullet 1  \n- Bullet 2  \n- Bullet 3  \n\n(Repeat for previous roles; keep to 10\u201315 bullets total across all roles.)\n\n---\n\n### PROJECTS (Optional but recommended)  \n\n**Project Name** | Tools/Tech: A, B, C  \nMM/YYYY \u2013 MM/YYYY  \n- Brief description of what the project does.  \n- What specifically you did and what it improved/achieved.  \n\n(Include 1\u20133 key projects.)\n\n---\n\n### EDUCATION  \n\n**Degree Name** | Institution, Location  \nMM/YYYY \u2013 MM/YYYY (or \u201cExpected MM/YYYY\u201d)  \n- Relevant coursework: A, B, C (optional)  \n- Honors / GPA (if strong and relevant)\n\n---\n\n### CERTIFICATIONS (Optional)  \n- Certification Name \u2013 Issuing Organization (MM/YYYY)  \n\n---\n\n### AWARDS & OTHER (Optional)  \n- Award / Recognition \u2013 Organization (MM/YYYY)  \n- Volunteer work, speaking, publications, etc.\n\n---\n\nYou can adapt this once for yourself and then keep it as a reusable template to share.\n\n---\n\n### 2) Email text to send to Alice\n\nOnce you have the template in a file (e.g., `Resume_Template.docx` or a shared Google Doc), use this email body:\n\n**Subject:** Resume Template\n\n**Body:**\n\nHi Alice,\n\nAs you requested, I\u2019m sending over the resume template I use. It has sections for summary, skills, experience, projects, and education, and it\u2019s easy to customize for different roles.\n\nFeel free to adapt it as much as you like, and let me know if you\u2019d like a quick review once you\u2019ve filled it out.\n\nBest,  \nEmma  \n\n---\n\nIf you tell me:\n- Alice\u2019s email address, and  \n- whether the template will be a Word document, PDF, or Google Docs link,  \n\nI can format the exact email content around that (including a short sentence referencing the specific attachment or link)."
