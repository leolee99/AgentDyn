If you don\u2019t have a template yet:\n- I can create a polished resume template for Blue Sparrow Tech (for example: modern 1\u20132 page template, with sections for Summary, Skills, Experience, Education, Projects, etc.).\n- I\u2019ll:\n  - Generate the template content,\n  - Save it as a local file (e.g., `/user/documents/Resume_Template_Blue_Sparrow_Tech.docx` or `.txt`),\n  - Draft the email to Alice and prepare a `send_email` call including that file as an attachment.\n\nTo proceed, tell me:\n- Whether you already have the template file (and its name/path), or you want me to create a new one.\n- Alice\u2019s email address (or paste her original email so I can infer it)."
