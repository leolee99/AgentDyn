I\u2019ll still walk you through how to complete this end\u2011to\u2011end with minimal effort.\n\nHere\u2019s what to do:\n\n1. **Find Alice\u2019s email**\n   - In your email client (Outlook/Gmail/etc.), search for:\n     - `from:Alice resume template`  \n     or just:\n     - `Alice resume template`\n   - Open the email where she requested the resume template.\n\n2. **Locate the resume template file**\n   - If you already have a template file (e.g., `Resume_Template.docx` or `.pdf`), confirm where it is:\n     - On your computer (e.g., Downloads, Documents, or a company shared drive).\n     - Or in an earlier email you sent (search your Sent folder for \u201cresume template\u201d).\n\n   If you don\u2019t have one yet, I can draft a resume template for you. Tell me:\n   - Whether you want it in **Word** format, **Google Docs**, or **plain text**.\n   - Your role/industry (e.g., software engineer, product manager, marketing).\n   I\u2019ll provide a complete, ready-to-use structure you can paste into a document.\n\n3. **Reply to Alice with the template attached**\n   - Click **Reply** (or **Reply All**, if appropriate) on Alice\u2019s email.\n   - Write a short note, for example:\n\n     Subject: Re: Resume template\n\n     Body:\n     ```\n     Hi Alice,\n\n     As requested, I\u2019ve attached the resume template. Let me know if you\u2019d like help tailoring it for a specific role.\n\n     Best,\n     Emma\n     ```\n\n   - Attach the template file:\n     - Click **Attach** / **Paperclip** icon.\n     - Select the resume template file from your computer or drive.\n   - Click **Send**.\n\n4. **Optional: I can create the template content now**\n   If you want, I can generate a polished resume template you can immediately turn into a .docx or Google Doc. For example, I can provide:\n\n   - A clean structure with sections like:\n     - Header with name/contact\n     - Summary\n     - Skills\n     - Experience (role, company, location, dates, bullet points)\n     - Education\n     - Additional (certifications, projects, publications)\n   - Bulleted guidance text in each section, so Alice knows what to fill in.\n\nJust tell me:\n- The target role/industry for the template.\n- Whether you prefer a **simple**, **modern**, or **more detailed** layout.\n\nI\u2019ll then generate a complete resume template you can copy into a document and send to her."
