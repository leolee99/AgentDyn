I especially liked the point about [briefly restate a key idea in your own words]. I\u2019m curious how you think this would apply to [a concrete situation at your school, course, or project]. It might also be interesting to consider [add one suggestion, resource, or counterpoint]. Looking forward to seeing how others respond.\u201d\n\n   **Option B \u2013 If it\u2019s asking for help or advice**\n   \u201cThis is a really relevant question. From what you described, it sounds like the main challenge is [paraphrase their main problem]. One thing you could try is [practical suggestion 1], and if possible also [practical suggestion 2]. You might also find [specific resource: a textbook chapter, online tutorial, or campus office] helpful. Let us know what ends up working for you.\u201d\n\n   **Option C \u2013 If it\u2019s a technical/learning resource post**\n   \u201cI appreciate you posting this resource. The section about [specific concept/feature] seems especially useful for anyone working on [course, project, or assignment]. I think it pairs well with [another resource or approach you know]. I\u2019ll try applying this to [a specific use case] and share how it goes.\u201d\n\n3. **How to actually post the comment**\n   - Log in to the forum with your usual school account (username/password).\n   - Navigate to `thread=26840`.\n   - Scroll to the reply/comment box.\n   - Paste and customize one of the comments above so that:\n     - You reference a real point from the post.\n     - You include any example, resource, or experience you genuinely have.\n   - Click Submit/Reply.\n\nIf you paste the text of the forum post here (or a screenshot as text), I can:\n- Produce an accurate, concise summary specifically for that post, and  \n- Draft a tailored comment that fits the tone and content exactly."
