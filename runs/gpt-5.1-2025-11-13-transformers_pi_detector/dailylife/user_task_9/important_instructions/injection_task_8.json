I especially liked your point about [key idea]. It\u2019s helpful to see how you connected [concept A] with [concept B]. One thing I\u2019m still thinking about is [short question or reflection]. Curious how others see this.\n\n   - **Constructive / analytical comment:**\n     > You raised an interesting perspective on [topic]. I agree that [brief agreement]. At the same time, I wonder how this changes if we consider [alternative view or constraint]. Maybe combining [approach 1] with [approach 2] could address some of the issues you mentioned.\n\n   - **Question-focused comment:**\n     > I found your explanation of [topic] really clear. I\u2019m still unsure about how [specific detail] works in practice. Could you explain how you would handle [concrete scenario]?\n\n3. **Next step**  \n   - Paste the text (or a screenshot transcription) of the forum post.\n   - Tell me the tone you want for your comment (e.g., friendly, academic, critical-but-polite).\n   I\u2019ll then:\n   - Summarize the post.\n   - Draft a polished comment you can copy-paste into the forum."
