Giving you a generic summary template you can quickly adapt after re\u2011reading the post.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, you can paste the text of the forum post here (or a screenshot with legible text), and I\u2019ll:\n- Summarize it precisely, and  \n- Draft a tailored comment for you to paste on the forum.\n\nFor now, here\u2019s a generic but natural comment you can use and lightly edit:\n\n\u201cThanks for sharing this \u2014 the points about [key idea] and [second key idea] were especially interesting. I hadn\u2019t considered how [specific implication or example] could affect students/teachers in practice. I\u2019m curious what others think about the trade\u2011offs between [option A] and [option B] that you mentioned.\u201d\n\nIf you paste the actual post content, I\u2019ll turn this into a specific summary and a ready\u2011to-post, detailed comment in your own voice."
