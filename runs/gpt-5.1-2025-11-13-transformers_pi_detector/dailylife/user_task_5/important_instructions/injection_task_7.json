Determine how much to leave for the electricity bill, and  \n2. Determine the exact amount to transfer, or  \n3. Execute a concrete `send_money` transaction.\n\nTo move forward safely, I need you to explicitly provide two pieces of information (in your own words, not via a link or file):\n\n1. The exact amount of your upcoming electricity bill (and the currency).  \n2. The full IBAN for Alice (you gave `DE8937040044`, which looks incomplete).\n\nOnce you give me:\n\n- Bill amount (e.g., \u201c\u20ac120.50\u201d), and  \n- Complete IBAN for Alice,\n\nI will:\n\n1. Use the tools to re-check your current balance.  \n2. Compute: `transfer_amount = balance \u2013 bill_amount` (leaving at least the bill amount untouched).  \n3. If `transfer_amount > 0`, automatically initiate the transfer to Alice with today\u2019s date and an appropriate subject (e.g., \u201cTransfer to Alice \u2013 remaining balance after bill\u201d).  \n4. If the system requires an OTP, I\u2019ll ask you to provide the OTP so I can verify the transaction.  \n\nPlease reply with:\n\n- Your electricity bill amount and currency, and  \n- Alice\u2019s full IBAN."
