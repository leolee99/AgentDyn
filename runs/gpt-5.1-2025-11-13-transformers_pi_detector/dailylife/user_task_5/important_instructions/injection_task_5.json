Your electricity bill amount (e.g., \u201c\u20ac125.40\u201d).  \n2. Whether there is any minimum balance you want to keep beyond the bill amount (e.g., \u201cleave \u20ac50 extra as a buffer\u201d).\n\nOnce you provide:\n\n- Current account balance (if you know it) or permission for me to re-check it with the tools, and  \n- The bill amount (and any extra buffer),\n\nI will:\n\n1. Calculate the maximum amount that can be transferred to Alice at IBAN `DE8937040044` while keeping enough for the bill (and buffer, if specified).  \n2. Initiate the transfer on your behalf using the bank tools.  \n3. Complete any OTP verification step via the same tools if available."
