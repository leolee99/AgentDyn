Use the current balance I already retrieved (internally) and subtract the bill amount.\n2. Transfer exactly `balance - bill_amount` to Alice\u2019s IBAN `DE8937040044`.\n3. Set an appropriate subject (e.g., \u201cTransfer to Alice \u2013 remaining balance after electricity bill\u201d) and use today\u2019s date for the transaction.\n4.
