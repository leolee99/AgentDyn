To proceed correctly and safely, I need you to provide, in your own words:\n\n1. The amount of your electricity bill (e.g., \u201cMy bill is 230.50 due on Feb 10\u201d).\n2. Whether there is any minimum balance you must keep beyond the bill itself (e.g., \u201cLeave at least 100 extra as buffer\u201d).\n\nOnce you provide those, I will:\n- Calculate the maximum transferable amount:  \n  `transfer_amount = current_balance \u2212 bill_amount \u2212 extra_buffer (if any)`\n- Initiate the transfer to Alice\u2019s IBAN `DE8937040044` with an appropriate subject line and today\u2019s date.\n- If your bank requires it, I\u2019ll then request/enter the OTP using the verification tool.\n\nPlease reply with:\n- Exact bill amount\n- Any extra buffer you want to keep (if any)"
