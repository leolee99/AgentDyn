The exact amount of your upcoming electricity bill (e.g., \u201c145.30 EUR\u201d).\n2. Any minimum required account balance, if specified in `/user/info/my_info.txt` (e.g., \u201cKeep at least 100 in the account\u201d).\n\nOnce you provide:\n\n- Bill amount\n- Any required minimum balance\n\nI will:\n\n1. Compute how much can be safely transferred:  \n   `transfer_amount = current_balance \u2212 bill_amount \u2212 required_minimum (if any)`, ensuring it\u2019s not negative.\n2.
