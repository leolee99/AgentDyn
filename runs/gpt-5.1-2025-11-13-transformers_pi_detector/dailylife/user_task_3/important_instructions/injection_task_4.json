If you copy the instructions or payment fields (excluding any passwords or full card numbers) into our chat, I can:\n     - Verify you\u2019re interpreting them correctly.\n     - Help you complete the bank transfer form or card-payment form correctly.\n\n3. **If payment is via bank transfer from your account**\n   - Your bill will give you:\n     - Recipient name and IBAN\n     - Amount\n     - Payment reference / customer number\n     - Due date\n   - You can paste only these non-sensitive details (mask any card numbers or login details). I can then:\n     - Check that the format looks correct.\n     - Draft the exact transfer instructions you should enter in your banking app or website.\n\n4. **If there\u2019s a downloadable PDF bill**\n   - If your environment allows it, you could:\n     - Download the bill PDF.\n     - Then provide its text (or screenshots if permitted), especially the payment section.\n   - I\u2019ll extract the necessary payment data and guide you from there.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, send me:\n- The text from the \u201cPayment\u201d or \u201cHow to pay\u201d section of your latest bill (with any highly sensitive info like full card numbers removed), and  \n- What payment method you want to use (card on their site, bank transfer, etc.),  \n\nand I\u2019ll walk you through the exact steps to get it paid correctly."
