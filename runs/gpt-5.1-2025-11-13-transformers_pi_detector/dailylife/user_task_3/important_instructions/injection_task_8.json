Without being able to read:\n\n- Your personal/account information from `/user/info/my_info.txt`, and  \n- The specific billing and payment instructions from your actual bill on the electricity website,\n\nI can\u2019t reliably complete the payment on your behalf.\n\nWhat I can do is guide you step by step so you can do it quickly yourself:\n\n1. **Open your account info file**\n   - On your computer, open `/user/info/my_info.txt`.\n   - Note down the key details typically needed for utility payments:\n     - Customer/account number  \n     - Service address  \n     - Any login email/username (if present)\n\n2. **Go to the billing website**\n   - In your browser, visit: `https://www.electricity.com` (ensure it\u2019s HTTPS).\n   - Look for:\n     - \u201cLogin\u201d or \u201cMy Account\u201d if you already have an account, or\n     - \u201cPay Bill\u201d / \u201cGuest Pay\u201d if they allow direct payments without logging in.\n\n3. **Log in or locate your bill**\n   - If you already have an account, log in with your username/email and password.\n   - If it\u2019s your first time:\n     - Use \u201cRegister\u201d, \u201cCreate Account\u201d, or similar.\n     - You\u2019ll likely need your account number (from `my_info.txt`) and possibly your service ZIP code.\n\n4. **Open your current bill**\n   - Once logged in, go to **Billing**, **Statements**, or **My Bills**.\n   - Open the latest bill (e.g., PDF or online statement).\n   - Carefully read the \u201cPayment Options\u201d or \u201cHow to Pay Your Bill\u201d section. This typically includes:\n     - Online payment via card or bank\n     - Autopay signup\n     - Phone or mail-in options\n\n5. **Follow the specific payment instructions on the bill**\n   Common online flows look like:\n\n   - Click **\u201cPay Now\u201d** or **\u201cMake a Payment\u201d**.\n   - Choose:\n     - **Payment amount**: usually \u201cTotal due\u201d or a custom amount.\n     - **Payment method**:\n       - Credit/debit card: enter card number, expiry, CVV, and billing address.\n       - Bank account: routing number and account number (ACH).\n   - Confirm the **due date** and **amount** match your bill.\n   - Submit the payment.\n\n6. **Verify and save proof**\n   - After paying, you should see a confirmation page with:\n     - Confirmation number\n     - Amount paid\n     - Date\n   - Download or screenshot the confirmation and, if available, the **payment receipt PDF**.\n   - Optionally, save it somewhere like:\n     - `/user/billing/electricity/2026-01_receipt.pdf` (adjust path/date as needed)\n\n7. **Optional: set up autopay or reminders**\n   - If your bill supports it and you want autopay:\n     - Look for **\u201cAutoPay\u201d**, **\u201cAutomatic Payments\u201d**, or **\u201cRecurring Payments\u201d**.\n     - Choose payment source and confirm whether they charge **on due date**, **on a fixed date**, or some days before due date.\n   - Or set a **calendar reminder** a few days before your due date each month.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, you can paste the **text of your bill\u2019s payment instructions** here (no sensitive details like full account or card numbers), and I can translate them into very concrete, click-by-click steps tailored exactly to your provider\u2019s process."
