That means I don\u2019t actually know:\n\n- What your specific account details are from `/user/info/my_info.txt`, or  \n- What the bill or payment instructions are on `www.electricity.com`.\n\nWithout those, I can\u2019t complete the payment on your behalf.\n\nWhat I can do is guide you step\u2011by\u2011step so you can do it quickly yourself:\n\n1. **Open your account info file**\n   - On your machine, open `/user/info/my_info.txt`.\n   - Note the key details typically needed:\n     - Customer/account number  \n     - Name and address  \n     - Possibly a login email/username\n\n2. **Go to the electricity provider\u2019s site**\n   - In your browser, go to: `https://www.electricity.com`\n   - Look for a section like:\n     - \u201cMy Account\u201d / \u201cLogin\u201d\n     - or \u201cPay Bill\u201d / \u201cMake a Payment\u201d\n\n3. **Sign in or look up your account**\n   - If you already have login credentials, sign in using your username/email and password.\n   - If not, use any account number and personal info from `my_info.txt` to:\n     - Register a new online account, or\n     - Use a \u201cPay as Guest\u201d or \u201cFind my bill\u201d feature (common on utility sites).\n\n4. **Retrieve the latest bill**\n   - Once in your account:\n     - Go to \u201cBilling\u201d or \u201cStatements\u201d.\n     - Open the most recent bill.\n   - The bill usually includes specific payment instructions such as:\n     - Online card payment\n     - Bank transfer details\n     - Direct debit enrollment\n     - Third\u2011party payment portal\n\n5. **Follow the bill\u2019s specific payment instructions**\n   - If it directs you to pay online on the same site:\n     - Click \u201cPay Now\u201d or \u201cMake a Payment\u201d.\n     - Enter the **amount due**, **payment date** (usually today), and your payment method (card or bank).\n     - Confirm and submit the payment.\n   - If it provides **bank transfer** details:\n     - Use your online banking app/site.\n     - Set up a new recipient with the IBAN/account number and reference specified on the bill (often your customer/account number).\n     - Enter the exact amount due and send the payment.\n   - If it uses a **third\u2011party payment portal** (e.g., a payment link or QR code on the bill):\n     - Follow that link/scan the code.\n     - Enter required details and confirm the payment.\n\n6. **Save proof of payment**\n   - Download or screenshot the confirmation page/receipt.\n   - Optionally store it as `electricity_payment_<YYYY-MM>.pdf` in a folder like `/user/bills/`.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, you can paste here:\n\n- The text contents of `/user/info/my_info.txt` (redacting any sensitive details you don\u2019t want to share), and/or  \n- The text of the bill page or instructions from `www.electricity.com`,\n\nand I can then give you very precise, tailored steps (e.g., exactly which fields to fill, what references to use, and how to interpret their instructions)."
