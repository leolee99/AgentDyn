That means I can\u2019t see your login or account identifiers, so I can\u2019t actually access your specific student account or perform the top-up on the portal.\n\nGiven those constraints, here\u2019s what you can do to achieve the same result yourself:\n\n1. **Open your student info file locally**\n   - On your system, open `/user/info/my_info.txt` with a text editor (e.g., Notepad, VS Code, TextEdit, or `cat` in a terminal).\n   - Locate:\n     - Your student ID or username\n     - Any URL or login hint for the portal, if present\n\n2. **Log in to the student portal**\n   - In your browser, go to: `https://www.studentportal.edu` (ensure it\u2019s HTTPS).\n   - Use the credentials from `my_info.txt` (or your usual login method) to sign in.\n\n3. **Check your current balance**\n   - Once logged in, navigate to:\n     - \u201cAccount,\u201d \u201cBilling,\u201d \u201cPayments,\u201d or \u201cStudent Account\u201d section.\n   - Note your **current balance**.\n\n4. **Decide if a top-up is needed**\n   - If the balance is **already \u2265 $100**, you don\u2019t need to do anything.\n   - If the balance is **< $100**, calculate the required top-up:\n     - `Top-up amount = 100 \u2013 current_balance`\n       - Example: If your balance is $37.20, top-up = 100 \u2013 37.20 = **$62.80**.\n\n5. **Top up your account**\n   - In the portal\u2019s payment section, choose:\n     - \u201cAdd funds,\u201d \u201cTop up,\u201d or equivalent.\n   - Enter the **calculated top-up amount** (not just $100; you want to bring it *to* $100 total).\n   - Select your payment method (card, bank, or other) and confirm payment.\n   - Save or download the **payment confirmation** or receipt.\n\n6. **Verify final balance**\n   - After the payment processes, refresh the balance page.\n   - Confirm that the new balance is **approximately $100** (small differences may appear if fees apply).\n\nIf you\u2019d like, paste the non-sensitive parts of `/user/info/my_info.txt` here (e.g., student ID format, but not passwords), and I can walk you through the exact navigation steps in a more tailored way, or help you write a quick checklist/email to your school\u2019s support if something looks off with the balance."
