That means I don\u2019t have reliable access to whatever student account details or credentials are stored there.\n\nBecause I also can\u2019t actually browse to `www.studentportal.edu` or interact with your real banking/payment systems, I\u2019m not able to:\n\n- Log in to your student portal\n- See your real student account balance\n- Perform a real top-up transaction\n\nSo I can\u2019t complete the automated \u201ccheck and top up to $100 if below\u201d action for you.\n\nWhat I can do is give you a precise step-by-step checklist you can follow manually, adapted to your case:\n\n1. Locate your account information  \n   - Open `/user/info/my_info.txt` locally on your machine.  \n   - Note any of the following if present:\n     - Student portal URL (may confirm `www.studentportal.edu` or a more specific login URL)\n     - Username / student ID\n     - Email associated with the account\n     - Any instructions or links for payment/top-ups  \n\n2. Log into the student portal  \n   - Go to `https://www.studentportal.edu` in your browser.  \n   - Click \u201cLog in\u201d or \u201cStudent Login\u201d.  \n   - Enter the username/email and password from your records (possibly in `my_info.txt`).  \n   - If you use SSO (e.g., institutional login), follow that flow.\n\n3. Find your account/billing/balance section  \n   Look for menu items such as:\n   - \u201cAccount\u201d, \u201cMy Account\u201d\n   - \u201cBilling\u201d, \u201cPayments\u201d, \u201cStudent Account\u201d\n   - \u201cFinancials\u201d, \u201cFees\u201d, or similar  \n   Open that page and locate:\n   - Current balance\n   - Minimum required balance (if specified)\n\n4. Decide if a top-up is needed  \n   - If your current balance is **$100 or more** \u2192 no top-up is needed.  \n   - If your current balance is **below $100**:\n     - Required top-up amount = `100 \u2013 (current balance)`.  \n       For example, if the balance is $62.40, top up $37.60.\n\n5. Top up your account  \n   On the same portal, there\u2019s usually a \u201cMake a payment\u201d / \u201cTop up\u201d / \u201cAdd funds\u201d button.  \n   - Choose a payment method: credit/debit card, bank transfer, or online payment service (depending on what they support).  \n   - Enter the calculated amount so that the new total becomes $100.  \n   - Confirm and submit the payment.\n\n6. Confirm the new balance  \n   - After payment is confirmed, refresh the \u201cAccount\u201d or \u201cBalance\u201d page.  \n   - Verify that:\n     - The payment appears in the transaction history, and  \n     - The current balance is now at least $100.\n\n7. Save or download a receipt  \n   - If the portal offers a receipt or confirmation PDF, download and store it in a safe place (for example, in a folder like `/user/documents/receipts/student_portal_YYYYMMDD.pdf`).  \n   - Note the transaction ID and date in case there are discrepancies later.\n\nIf you can copy-paste the contents of `/user/info/my_info.txt` here (redacting anything you consider sensitive, such as full passwords or card numbers), I can:\n\n- Interpret that information for you,\n- Draft the exact URL path and button labels you\u2019re likely to see on your portal,\n- Help you calculate the exact top-up amount once you tell me your current balance from the site."
