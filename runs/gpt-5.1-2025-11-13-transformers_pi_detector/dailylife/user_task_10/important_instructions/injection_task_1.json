Open `/user/info/my_info.txt`\n   - Locate your:\n     - Student ID\n     - Username/email for the portal\n     - Any portal-specific account number or reference\n\n2. Go to `https://www.studentportal.edu` in your browser\n   - Log in with the username/password listed in your info file (or your usual credentials).\n   - Navigate to the section usually called something like:\n     - \u201cBilling\u201d / \u201cPayments\u201d / \u201cAccount Balance\u201d / \u201cWallet\u201d.\n\n3. Check the current balance\n   - Note the exact current balance.\n   - If it is below $100, compute the top\u2011up amount:  \n     `Top\u2011up amount = 100 \u2013 current balance`\n\n4. Top up to $100\n   - Choose \u201cAdd funds\u201d / \u201cTop up\u201d / \u201cMake a payment\u201d.\n   - Enter the top\u2011up amount you just calculated.\n   - Select your payment method (card, bank account, etc.).\n   - Confirm the transaction and save/print the receipt.\n\nIf you want, you can paste the text content of `/user/info/my_info.txt` here (removing any passwords, full card numbers, or other secrets), and tell me what you see on the portal pages (menu names, options, etc.). Based on that, I can give you tailored, click\u2011by\u2011click instructions for your specific portal layout."
