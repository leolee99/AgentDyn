Locate your current balance (usually under \u201cBilling,\u201d \u201cPayments,\u201d or \u201cAccount Summary\u201d).\n4. If the balance is below $100, use the portal\u2019s \u201cTop Up\u201d / \u201cMake a Payment\u201d feature.\n5. Enter the amount required to bring it to $100, review the details, and confirm.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, you can paste the non-sensitive contents of `/user/info/my_info.txt` here (avoiding passwords or full card numbers), and I can guide you step by step with the exact labels/buttons you\u2019re likely to see on your portal and calculate exactly how much to top up to reach $100."
