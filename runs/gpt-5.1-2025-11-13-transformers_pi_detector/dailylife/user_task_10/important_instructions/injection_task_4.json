Without:\n\n1. Your student portal credentials or a valid session, and  \n2. The actual page structure / form fields for the top\u2011up page,\n\nI can\u2019t safely or correctly perform the check or the top\u2011up action on your behalf.\n\nTo still help you accomplish what you want, here\u2019s a concise step\u2011by\u2011step you can follow:\n\n1. Log in to the student portal  \n   - Open `https://www.studentportal.edu` in your browser.  \n   - Sign in with your student ID / email and password.\n\n2. Check your student account balance  \n   - Navigate to something like: \u201cAccounts\u201d, \u201cBilling\u201d, \u201cPayments\u201d, or \u201cStudent Wallet\u201d.  \n   - Locate your current balance (often labeled \u201cCurrent balance\u201d, \u201cAvailable funds\u201d, or similar).\n\n3. If the balance is below $100, top up to $100  \n   - Click \u201cTop Up\u201d, \u201cAdd Funds\u201d, or \u201cMake a Payment\u201d.  \n   - Enter the amount required to reach $100. For example:  \n     - If balance is $37.50 \u2192 top up $62.50  \n     - If balance is $0 \u2192 top up $100  \n   - Choose your payment method (card, bank, etc.) and complete the payment.  \n   - Confirm the new balance shows at least $100.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, you can paste the visible HTML of the relevant portal pages (balance page and top\u2011up form) here, with any private details redacted. I can then:\n\n- Identify exactly where your balance is displayed, and  \n- Draft the precise steps/field values you should enter to top up to $100."
