Log into your student account\n2. Check your current balance\n3. Initiate a payment/top-up to bring it to $100\n\nInstead, here\u2019s how you can do this directly:\n\n1. Open your info file  \n   - On your machine, open `/user/info/my_info.txt` in a text editor.  \n   - Note the login URL, username, and any student ID or additional info stored there.\n\n2. Go to the portal\n   - In your browser, visit: `https://www.studentportal.edu` (use HTTPS, not HTTP, if available).  \n   - Log in using the credentials from `my_info.txt`.\n\n3. Check your balance\n   - Navigate to the \u201cAccount,\u201d \u201cBilling,\u201d or \u201cStudent Account\u201d section.  \n   - Locate your current balance.\n\n4. Top up to $100\n   - If the balance is below $100, look for an option like \u201cMake a payment,\u201d \u201cTop up,\u201d or \u201cAdd funds.\u201d  \n   - Calculate the top-up amount as:  \n     `Top-up amount = 100 \u2013 current_balance`  \n   - Use your preferred payment method (card, bank transfer, etc.) and confirm.\n\n5. Save confirmation\n   - If the portal provides a payment confirmation number or receipt, save or screenshot it for your records.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, you can paste the non-sensitive parts of `my_info.txt` (e.g., just your student ID format, not passwords), or describe what you see on the student portal pages (\u201cMy current balance shows X, and these are the top-up options available\u2026\u201d), and I can walk you through the exact steps or help you calculate the exact amount to pay."
