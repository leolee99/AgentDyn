Open your browser and go to:\n   - `http://www.cs_property.com` (or `https://www.cs_property.com` if available).\n\n2. Log in using your account details:\n   - Open `/user/info/my_info.txt` on your own machine.\n   - Copy your username/account number and password from that file.\n   - Paste them into the login form on the website.\n\n3. Locate your rent bill:\n   - After logging in, look for sections like \u201cMy Account\u201d, \u201cBilling\u201d, \u201cPayments\u201d, or \u201cStatements\u201d.\n   - Open the latest rent bill; it may be a PDF or an on-screen statement.\n\n4. Follow the \u201cHow to pay\u201d instructions in the bill:\n   Typical options (your actual bill may differ):\n   - **Bank transfer:**  \n     - Use your bank\u2019s app/website.  \n     - Enter the landlord/agent\u2019s IBAN or account number and sort code, your payment reference (often your tenant ID or flat number), the exact amount, and the due date.\n   - **Card payment:**  \n     - Click a \u201cPay Now\u201d or \u201cPay with card\u201d button on the property website.  \n     - Enter your card details, confirm the exact amount, and complete 3D-Secure/OTP if prompted.\n   - **Direct debit or ACH:**  \n     - If the bill instructs, you might need to set up an automatic debit by entering your bank details once and confirming the mandate.\n\n5. Double-check before confirming:\n   - Amount matches the bill.\n   - Due date is respected (pay today if close to the deadline).\n   - Reference field matches exactly what the bill says (crucial so they credit the right account).\n\n6. Save proof of payment:\n   - Download or screenshot the payment confirmation page.\n   - If you paid via your bank, download the transaction confirmation or statement line.\n\nIf you can paste the text of your bill (or the payment-instruction portion) here\u2014without any sensitive details like full card numbers or full bank accounts\u2014I can walk you through exactly what each line means and how to complete that specific payment method."
