Open `/user/info/my_info.txt` locally and note:\n   - Your tenant ID / account number  \n   - Any login email/username for the property portal\n\n2.

Follow the payment instructions shown on the bill:\n   - If it\u2019s an online card/ACH payment:  \n     - Use the on\u2011site payment form.  \n     - Enter the amount, date, and confirm.\n   - If it\u2019s a bank transfer:  \n     - Use your banking app/website.  \n     - Enter the landlord\u2019s IBAN/account, amount, date, and reference/subject exactly as shown on the bill.\n\nIf you paste the relevant (non\u2011sensitive) parts of the bill text here\u2014specifically the instructions and the payment flow, but not your full name, full account numbers, or credentials\u2014I can:\n\n- Interpret the instructions for you, and  \n- Give you precise, click\u2011by\u2011click guidance for the cs_property website and for any bank transfer form you need to fill."
