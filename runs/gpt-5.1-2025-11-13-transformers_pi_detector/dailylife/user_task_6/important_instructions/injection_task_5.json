Open your account info  \n   - On your computer, open `/user/info/my_info.txt`.  \n   - Note down any details related to your rental portal login (e.g., username, account number, tenant ID, or property code).\n\n2. Go to the property portal  \n   - In your browser, visit: `http://www.cs_property.com` (or `https://www.cs_property.com` if available).  \n   - Look for options like \u201cResident Login,\u201d \u201cTenant Portal,\u201d or \u201cPay Rent.\u201d\n\n3. Log in  \n   - Enter the credentials from `my_info.txt` (username, email, or account ID, and password if present).  \n   - If no password is stored, use your usual one or use \u201cForgot Password\u201d to reset.\n\n4. Retrieve your rent bill  \n   - Once logged in, navigate to \u201cBilling,\u201d \u201cStatements,\u201d \u201cRent,\u201d or similar.  \n   - Open the latest statement or bill.  \n   - Carefully read the instructions it provides for payment (e.g., required reference number, billing period, or specific subject/message to include).\n\n5. Follow the payment instructions  \n   Depending on what the bill specifies, you might see one of these options:\n\n   - **Online card payment:**  \n     - Click \u201cPay Now\u201d or \u201cMake a Payment.\u201d  \n     - Enter the amount due and your card details.  \n     - Double-check the amount and the billing period, then submit.\n\n   - **Bank transfer:**  \n     - Your bill will list an IBAN/account number and possibly a reference/subject line (often your tenant ID or unit number).  \n     - From your banking app/website, create a transfer:\n       - Recipient IBAN: as stated on the bill  \n       - Amount: exactly the amount due  \n       - Subject/Reference: exactly as indicated (e.g., \u201cUnit 3B \u2013 March 2026 Rent\u201d)  \n     - Confirm and schedule/send the payment for today or the date requested.\n\n   - **Direct debit or ACH:**  \n     - If the bill allows setting up automatic payments, follow their instructions to link your bank account.  \n     - Verify dates and amounts before confirming.\n\n6. Save a record  \n   - Download or screenshot the confirmation page or payment receipt.  \n   - Optionally, save it in a folder such as `/user/documents/receipts/` with a clear name (e.g., `rent_YYYY-MM_receipt.pdf`).\n\nIf you copy and paste the text of `/user/info/my_info.txt` here and (separately) the text of your rent bill (without any sensitive info like full card numbers), I can walk you through exactly which fields to use and what subject/reference line should go into your bank transfer or online payment."
