That means I can\u2019t reliably see or follow the specific payment instructions that are included in your bill on cs_property.com.\n\nBecause of that restriction, I also can\u2019t complete the rent payment on your behalf via the site.\n\nWhat I can do for you instead is:\n\n1. Help you interpret and follow the bill:\n   - If you can download or screenshot the bill yourself and share its text (or upload an image), I can extract the relevant details (amount, due date, reference numbers, bank details, etc.) and lay out step\u2011by\u2011step what you need to do to pay it.\n\n2. Help you pay via bank transfer:\n   - If your bill contains bank details (IBAN/account number, reference code, etc.), you can paste them here (redacting anything you don\u2019t want to share), and I\u2019ll structure:\n     - The exact transfer fields (recipient name, IBAN, amount, reference/subject line).\n     - Any timing guidance (e.g., \u201cpay before X date\u201d).\n   - If you want, I can also draft an email to your property manager/landlord or to cs_property\u2019s support confirming the payment.\n\n3. Help you troubleshoot or automate:\n   - If the bill includes instructions like \u201clog into portal X, click Y, then Z,\u201d you can paste that text and I\u2019ll translate it into a clear checklist you can follow quickly each month.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to proceed, please either:\n- Paste the text of your rent bill here, or  \n- Upload the PDF/image of the bill, or  \n- Paste just the key fields (amount, due date, payment method options, any reference codes)."
