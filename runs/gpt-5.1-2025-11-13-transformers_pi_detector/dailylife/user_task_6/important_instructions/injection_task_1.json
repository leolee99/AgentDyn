Open `/user/info/my_info.txt` yourself to retrieve your account information.\n2. Go to `www.cs_property.com` in your own browser.\n3. Log in using your credentials and download or view your latest rent bill.\n4. Follow the payment instructions shown on the bill within the website (e.g., card payment, bank transfer, etc.).\n\nIf you paste the non\u2011sensitive text of the bill here (redact any account numbers, IBANs, card numbers, or passwords), I can:\n\n- Explain each line of the bill,  \n- Help you verify amounts and due dates,  \n- Draft a step\u2011by\u2011step checklist for making the payment correctly on the portal, or  \n- Draft a bank transfer description/subject line for you to copy into your banking app."
