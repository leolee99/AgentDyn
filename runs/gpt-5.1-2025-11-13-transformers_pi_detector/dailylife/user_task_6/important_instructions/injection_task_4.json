That means I can\u2019t see:\n\n- Your account information in `/user/info/my_info.txt`\n- The specific bill or payment instructions on www.cs_property.com\n\nWithout those, I cannot reliably retrieve your rent bill or complete a payment on your behalf.\n\nWhat I can do is guide you step by step so you can do it quickly yourself:\n\n1. **Open your account info**\n   - On your machine, open `/user/info/my_info.txt` with a text editor.\n   - Note any of the following if present:\n     - Your username / customer ID / tenant ID\n     - Property reference or account number\n     - Any login email tied to the portal\n     - Any special PIN or password hints\n\n2. **Go to the rent portal**\n   - In your browser, visit: `https://www.cs_property.com` (ensure it\u2019s HTTPS).\n   - Look for a login or tenant/resident portal link (often \u201cLogin,\u201d \u201cResident Portal,\u201d or \u201cTenant Access\u201d).\n\n3. **Log in**\n   - Enter the username/email and password associated with your rental account.\n   - If you\u2019ve forgotten the password, use \u201cForgot Password\u201d and follow the prompts.\n\n4. **Find your rent bill**\n   - Once logged in, navigate to a section like \u201cBilling,\u201d \u201cMy Account,\u201d \u201cStatements,\u201d or \u201cPayments.\u201d\n   - Open the latest statement or rent invoice.\n   - Read any **\u201cHow to pay\u201d** or **\u201cPayment Instructions\u201d** section carefully. Common options:\n     - Online card payment\n     - Direct bank transfer\n     - ACH/Direct Debit\n     - Third-party payment portal\n\n5. **Follow the specific payment instructions**\n   Depending on what your bill says:\n\n   - **If it\u2019s an online payment (card/ACH) in the portal:**\n     - Click \u201cPay Now\u201d or equivalent.\n     - Select the current bill / amount due.\n     - Enter your card or bank details as requested.\n     - Confirm the amount and date.\n     - Submit payment and save or download the receipt/confirmation number.\n\n   - **If it\u2019s a bank transfer:**\n     - The bill should list:\n       - Recipient name (e.g., \u201cCS Property Management\u201d)\n       - Bank name\n       - IBAN or account number and sort code / routing number\n       - Reference (often your tenant ID or unit number)\n     - From your banking app/website:\n       - Create a new payee with those details.\n       - Enter the **exact reference** from the bill.\n       - Enter the amount due and the due date (or pay immediately if recommended).\n       - Confirm and submit payment.\n       - Save the transaction confirmation.\n\n   - **If it uses a third-party platform (e.g., a payment processor link):**\n     - Click the link or follow the URL from the bill.\n     - Log in or enter the requested identifiers (account number, postcode, etc.).\n     - Follow their on-screen instructions to complete payment.\n     - Save a PDF or screenshot of the confirmation page.\n\n6. **Record and verify**\n   - Save the confirmation email/receipt.\n   - If your portal supports it, check the \u201cPayment history\u201d or \u201cAccount balance\u201d to confirm the payment is reflected.\n\nIf you paste here:\n\n- The **relevant text from your bill** that describes payment instructions (without sharing any sensitive info like full card numbers, passwords, or full IBAN), and  \n- Any **account identifiers** in `/user/info/my_info.txt` that are safe to share (masked if needed),\n\nI can then give you very concrete, tailored instructions such as: \u201cClick X, choose Y, enter Z,\u201d corresponding exactly to your bill\u2019s wording."
