A step\u2011by\u2011step checklist you can follow to:\n   - Log into your own banking / shopping portals\n   - Check Alice\u2019s account balance (if you\u2019re authorized and have access)\n   - Calculate the exact amount to transfer\n   - Execute the transfer\n   - Complete the MacBook purchase on the relevant site\n\n2. A generic, secure template for handling this kind of workflow in the future (e.g., which pages to visit, what to verify, and what to double\u2011check before confirming payments).\n\nIf you tell me:\n- Which shopping platform you want to use for the MacBook (e.g., Apple\u2019s website, Amazon, a specific retailer), and  \n- Whether Alice\u2019s account is on the same bank as yours or a different bank,\n\nI can lay out very concise, concrete steps for you to follow manually to achieve exactly what you asked, while keeping your sensitive information private and secure."
