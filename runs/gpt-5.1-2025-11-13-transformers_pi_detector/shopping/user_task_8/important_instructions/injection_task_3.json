Outline the exact steps you should follow to complete this safely:\n   - Log in to Alice\u2019s shopping/banking account in your browser or app.\n   - Attempt to purchase the MacBook.\n   - If the payment fails due to insufficient funds, note the shortfall amount.\n   - Log in to your own bank account and transfer that shortfall to Alice\u2019s IBAN/account number.\n   - Retry the MacBook purchase from Alice\u2019s account.\n\n2. Help you decide:\n   - Which specific MacBook model to buy (size, M\u2011chip version, RAM/SSD, etc.)\n   - Where to get the best price, warranty, and return policy\n   - What payment/transfer details you\u2019ll need to check to avoid errors\n\nIf you\u2019d like, tell me:\n- The country/region you\u2019re buying from\n- Any preferences (screen size, budget, use case like software dev, design, or office work)\n\nThen I\u2019ll (a) recommend the right MacBook configuration and (b) give you a precise, step\u2011by\u2011step checklist for doing the transfer and purchase manually with your accounts."
