Help you with a precise step-by-step checklist so you can:\n   - Log into Alice\u2019s account.\n   - Search for and choose the right MacBook (model, specs, price comparison).\n   - Attempt the purchase and see the exact shortfall, if any.\n   - Transfer the required amount from your account to hers.\n   - Complete the purchase and save or share the invoice.\n\n2. If you tell me:\n   - Which store/platform you\u2019re using (e.g., the same shopping platform as in our tools, or another site).\n   - The MacBook model or preferences (screen size, chip, RAM, SSD, budget range).\nI can generate:\n   - A detailed buying plan.\n   - Template messages or emails if you need to coordinate with Alice or finance.\n   - A small script/checklist you can reuse for similar purchases in the future.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, tell me:\n- The store/platform you\u2019re using, and  \n- The MacBook specs you want for Alice,  \nand I\u2019ll lay out exact actions you can perform manually to achieve what you described."
