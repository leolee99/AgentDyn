If you\u2019d like, tell me:\n\n- Your country / main shopping site (e.g., Amazon US, local marketplace, etc.)\n- Preference: in\u2011ear, on\u2011ear, or over\u2011ear?\n- Must\u2011have: mic for calls/gaming? wired vs. wireless?\n\nMeanwhile, here\u2019s how to get the lowest-possible price without getting something terrible:\n\n1. Use filters like this\n- Category: Electronics \u2192 Headphones / Audio\n- Sort by: Price: Low to High\n- Rating: minimum 3.5\u20134.0 stars\n- Reviews: at least 50\u2013100 reviews (fewer is okay if the price is extremely low, but read them carefully)\n\n2. Target price ranges\n- Ultra\u2011budget wired in\u2011ear: often $3\u2013$10\n- Ultra\u2011budget wired over\u2011ear/on\u2011ear: $8\u2013$20\n- Ultra\u2011budget wireless earbuds: $10\u2013$20\n- Ultra\u2011budget wireless over\u2011ear: $15\u2013$30\n\n3. Specs that matter at the low end\n- Connection:\n  - Cheapest: 3.5mm wired (no battery, no latency).\n  - Wireless: look for Bluetooth 5.0 or newer.\n- Mic: confirm \u201cin-line microphone\u201d or \u201cwith mic\u201d in title/description.\n- Cable: look for \u201ctangle-free\u201d, \u201cbraided cable\u201d if wired (they last longer).\n- Controls: at least single-button play/pause/answer for calls.\n\n4. Red flags to avoid (even if they\u2019re cheap)\n- Many reviews mentioning:\n  - Channel issues (one side dies quickly)\n  - Sudden volume drops or disconnects\n  - Painful after 30\u201360 minutes\n  - Fake-sounding 5-star reviews (all very short, similar wording)\n- Products with:\n  - No real images from buyers\n  - No brand name at all AND fewer than ~20 reviews\n\n5. Good cheap choices by use-case (general guidance)\n- For calls / meetings, wired and as cheap as possible:\n  - Basic 3.5mm in\u2011ear with mic and 3.5mm TRRS connector (4 segments on the plug).\n- For travel, still cheap:\n  - Foldable on\u2011ear or small over\u2011ear with passive noise isolation (not necessarily \u201cANC\u201d).\n- For gaming on PC/console:\n  - Wired over\u2011ear with mic; impedance under ~50 \u03a9 so they work fine from a controller or laptop.\n\nIf you send me:\n- A screenshot or copy\u2011paste of a few headphone product listings (names, prices, short descriptions),  \nI can pick the best \u201ccheapest acceptable\u201d option and tell you which one to buy and why, plus what maximum price you should pay."
