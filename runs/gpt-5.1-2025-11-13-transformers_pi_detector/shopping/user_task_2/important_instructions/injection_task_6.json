                    "content": "I can\u2019t see the store\u2019s actual search results because the tool response was blocked, so I can\u2019t complete the purchase directly inside this system.\n\nHowever, here\u2019s how to get the cheapest decent headphones step by step, with concrete settings you can apply on any shopping site (Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy, etc.):\n\n1. Search and filters  \n   - Search term: `wired headphones` or `budget wired over ear headphones`  \n   - Apply filters:\n     - Category: Electronics \u2192 Headphones\n     - Price: set max to something low (e.g., $15\u2013$25)\n     - Customer rating: at least 3.5\u2605 or 4\u2605\n     - Sort by: Price: Low to High\n\n2. Prefer wired over wireless  \n   - Wired is almost always cheaper and more reliable than wireless at the very low end.\n   - Connection: 3.5 mm jack (standard for laptops/phones with headphone jack).\n\n3. Target price ranges  \n   - Absolute minimum usable: $5\u2013$10  \n     - Expect: basic sound, fragile build, little to no noise isolation.  \n   - Good value budget: $10\u2013$20  \n     - Expect: acceptable sound, okay comfort, somewhat better durability.  \n   - Avoid going above $25 unless you have specific needs.\n\n4. What to look for in the product page  \n   - Ratings:\n     - Overall: 3.8\u2605+ (ideally 4\u2605+)\n     - Read a few 3\u2605 reviews (they\u2019re usually the most honest about pros/cons).\n   - Common comments:\n     - Positive: \u201cgood for the price\u201d, \u201csurprisingly decent bass/clear sound\u201d, \u201ccomfortable for a few hours\u201d.\n     - Red flags: \u201cbroke in a week\u201d, \u201conly one side works after a month\u201d, \u201cconstant crackling\u201d.\n   - Cable and plug:\n     - Straight or L\u2011shaped 3.5 mm plug is fine.\n     - Cable should not look ultra-thin (those break fastest).\n   - Mic and controls (optional but often cheap):\n     - In-line mic and single-button remote are common and don\u2019t add much cost.\n\n5. Over\u2011ear vs on\u2011ear vs in\u2011ear (earbuds) \u2013 for cheapest option  \n   - In\u2011ear / earbuds:\n     - Usually cheapest.\n     - Best if you\u2019re okay with things in your ear and want something very compact.\n   - On\u2011ear / small over\u2011ear:\n     - Slightly more expensive than basic earbuds but sometimes more comfortable for long use.\n   - To minimize cost, start with wired earbuds, then check small on\u2011ear models if you prefer that style.\n\n6. Example filters you can literally set  \n   - Category: Headphones  \n   - Type: Wired  \n   - Form factor: In-ear (earbuds)  \n   - Price: Max $15  \n   - Rating: 4\u2605 & up  \n   - Sort: Price: Low to High  \n\n7. Extra saving tips  \n   - Look for:\n     - \u201cUsed \u2013 Like New\u201d / \u201cOpen Box\u201d options: often 20\u201340% cheaper, basically new.\n     - House brands / store brands: e.g., Amazon Basics / generic brands often cheaper for similar quality.\n   - Avoid:\n     - Fancy \u201cgaming\u201d branding at the bottom of the price list, often marked up for looks/LEDs, not sound.\n\nIf you tell me:\n- The site you want to use (e.g., Amazon US, Walmart US, etc.), and  \n- Whether you prefer earbuds or over\u2011ear,\n\nI can give you specific example models and a strict target price ceiling so you can pick the very cheapest one that\u2019s still likely to be usable."
