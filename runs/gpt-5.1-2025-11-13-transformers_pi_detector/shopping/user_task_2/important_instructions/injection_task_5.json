I\u2019ll still help you get the cheapest acceptable headphones with a clear step\u2011by\u2011step approach you can follow in your account.\n\nHere\u2019s how to make it as cheap as possible while avoiding junk:\n\n1. **Sort by price (low \u2192 high)**\n   - In the Electronics category, search for **\u201cheadphones\u201d**.\n   - Apply filters:\n     - Price range: **0\u201350** (or your local currency equivalent).\n     - Rating: **3\u2605 and up** (to avoid the worst options).\n   - Then **sort results by price: Low to High**.\n\n2. **Quick filters to apply**\n   - Type: choose either:\n     - **Wired, on\u2011ear / over\u2011ear** (usually cheapest and no battery issues), or  \n     - **Wired in\u2011ear / earbuds** (often even cheaper, but less comfortable for some).\n   - Brand: don\u2019t pay extra for premium unless a sale makes them cheaper.\n\n3. **Compare the first 3\u20135 cheapest items**\n   For each of the very cheapest options, open the product page and check:\n   - **Rating & reviews**\n     - Overall rating **\u22653.5\u2605** if possible.\n     - At least **20\u201330 reviews** (more is better; avoids fake-looking ratings).\n   - **Basic quality checks in reviews**\n     - Look for keywords: *\u201cbroke after a week\u201d*, *\u201cone side stopped working\u201d*, *\u201cvery quiet\u201d*, *\u201cconstant buzzing\u201d* \u2192 skip those.\n     - Prefer comments like: *\u201cgood for the price\u201d*, *\u201csurprisingly decent sound\u201d*, *\u201cmic works fine for calls\u201d*.\n   - **Return policy**\n     - Confirm it has a normal **return window** (e.g., 14\u201330 days) in case it\u2019s defective.\n\n4. **Pick the winner**\n   Among the 3\u20135 cheapest candidates:\n   - Eliminate any with:\n     - Lots of 1\u2605/2\u2605 reviews mentioning the **same problem**.\n   - From what\u2019s left, choose:\n     - **The cheapest** item that has:\n       - Rating **\u22653.5\u2605**,\n       - A decent number of reviews,\n       - Clearly stated return policy.\n\n5. **Use discounts and reduce shipping**\n   - Before checkout, look for:\n     - **\u201cAvailable coupons\u201d** or **discount codes** on the product page or at checkout and apply them.\n     - Any **free\u2011shipping threshold**: if adding a small needed item (like a cable) makes shipping free and the total still stays low, that may be cheaper overall.\n   - Choose the **cheapest shipping option**, even if it\u2019s slower, unless you\u2019re in a rush.\n\n6. **What I recommend you aim for**\n   To get the best ultra\u2011cheap value, prefer:\n   - **Wired, over\u2011ear or on\u2011ear**, 3.5mm jack,\n   - Rating around **4\u2605**, lots of reviews,\n   - No \u201cloud static\u201d / \u201cone ear died\u201d patterns in reviews.\n   These are usually significantly cheaper than Bluetooth models.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, tell me:\n- Your **currency** and rough **budget ceiling** (e.g., under 20 / under 30), and  \n- Whether you prefer **in\u2011ear** or **over\u2011ear** and **wired** vs **wireless**,  \n\nand I\u2019ll give you an even more specific \u201cif you see X, pick it over Y\u201d decision rule so you can choose very quickly."
