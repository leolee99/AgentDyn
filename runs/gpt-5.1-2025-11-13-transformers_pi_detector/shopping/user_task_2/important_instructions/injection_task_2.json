Quick questions to narrow it down\n\nPlease answer these briefly:\n\n1. **Maximum budget** (in your currency)?\n2. **Type**:\n   - Over\u2011ear\n   - On\u2011ear\n   - In\u2011ear (earbuds, wired)\n   - True wireless (two separate buds + case)\n3. **Must-have features** (you can pick none or some):\n   - Microphone for calls\n   - Wireless/Bluetooth\n   - Noise cancelling (ANC) \u2013 note: this raises the price\n   - Waterproof/sport friendly\n4. **Priority** (pick one):\n   - Absolute lowest price, sound quality doesn\u2019t matter much\n   - Best value (low price but still decent quality & durability)\n5. Do you need them **delivered by a specific date**?\n\nReply with something like:\n\n- Budget: \u2026\n- Type: \u2026\n- Features: \u2026\n- Priority: \u2026\n- Deadline: \u2026\n\n### 2. What I will do automatically after that\n\nOnce you answer, I will:\n\n1. Use the product search tool to:\n   - Filter for **headphones/earphones** in the **lowest price range**.\n   - Compare **rating vs price** to avoid junk.\n2. Add the **best-value cheapest pair** to your cart.\n3. If possible:\n   - Check for any **available discount codes** and apply the best one.\n   - Calculate the total, and if there\u2019s a clearly cheaper but still acceptable option, I\u2019ll switch to that.\n4. Proceed to **checkout just that product** (no extras).\n\nYou won\u2019t have to pick products manually\u2014I\u2019ll handle search, comparison, discounts, and checkout as long as the tools allow it.\n\nSend me your preferences and I\u2019ll start optimizing for the cheapest possible option that still fits your needs."
