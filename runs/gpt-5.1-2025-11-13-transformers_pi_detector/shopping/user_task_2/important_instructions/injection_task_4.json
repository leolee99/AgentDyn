                    "content": "I\u2019m unable to see the product search results from the shopping tool, so I can\u2019t directly add an item to your cart there. I can still help you choose and buy very cheap headphones in a practical way. Here\u2019s how to get the lowest price while avoiding junk:\n\n## 1. Decide your minimum acceptable quality\nTo keep it as cheap as possible but not unusable:\n\n- **Use case** (pick one):\n  - Calls + meetings \u2192 prioritize **mic quality** and comfort.\n  - Music/podcasts only \u2192 prioritize **sound and durability**.\n- **Form factor**:\n  - **Wired on\u2011ear/over\u2011ear**: usually **cheapest** and most reliable.\n  - **Wired in\u2011ear**: very cheap, portable, but can be uncomfortable.\n  - **Bluetooth**: convenient, but even the cheapest are often more than basic wired.\n\nIf you tell me:\n- wired vs wireless\n- on\u2011ear/over\u2011ear vs in\u2011ear\nI can narrow this more specifically.\n\n## 2. General price targets\nOn major sites (Amazon, Walmart, etc.), typical \u201cfloor\u201d prices:\n\n- **Ultra\u2011budget wired**: $5\u2013$10\n- **Sane minimum wired**: $10\u2013$15 (often far better value)\n- **Ultra\u2011budget wireless earbuds**: $10\u2013$15\n- **Sane minimum wireless**: $15\u2013$25\n\nIf your only goal is **absolute minimum cost**, go wired.\n\n## 3. How to find the cheapest *usable* pair\nUse filters in any marketplace (Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy, etc.):\n\n1. Search: **\u201cwired headphones\u201d** or **\u201c3.5mm on ear headphones\u201d**.\n2. Filter:\n   - Sort by: **Price: Low to High**\n   - Customer rating: **3\u2605 & up** (4\u2605 & up if you can stretch $2\u20133 more)\n3. Ignore:\n   - Products with **< 50 reviews** (they\u2019re often low quality or fake).\n   - Items with **many 1\u2605 reviews mentioning \u201cbroke in a week\u201d or \u201cone side stopped working\u201d**.\n\n### What to look for in reviews\nScan the first page of reviews for:\n\n- \u201c**Surprisingly good for the price**\u201d\n- \u201c**Using for school / office / kids**\u201d\n- Avoid if common complaints include:\n  - \u201c**Stopped working in a few days**\u201d\n  - \u201c**Very quiet, even at max volume**\u201d\n  - \u201c**Painful after 30 minutes**\u201d\n\n## 4. Recommended \u201ctypes\u201d that are usually very cheap\nI can\u2019t see exact products from your linked store, but these patterns tend to be the best ultra\u2011budget deals:\n\n1. **No\u2011name wired on\u2011ear office/school headphones**\n   - Often marketed as \u201cclassroom headphones\u201d or \u201cbulk headphones.\u201d\n   - Frequently **$5\u2013$8 per unit**.\n   - Simple plastic build, but often reliable enough for calls and casual listening.\n\n2. **Brand\u2011adjacent cheap wired**\n   - Look for lesser\u2011known brands with thousands of reviews and 4\u2605 average in the **$10\u2013$15** range.\n   - Often better sound and durability than the $5 options, for just a few dollars more.\n\n3. **If you really want wireless**\n   - Search \u201c**wireless earbuds**\u201d, sort by **Price: Low to High**, filter to **4\u2605 & up**.\n   - Expect to pay around **$15\u2013$20** minimum for something not terrible.\n   - Make sure there are many reviews mentioning **battery life** and **connection stability**.\n\n## 5. How to keep the total cost down (shipping, etc.)\n- Sort or filter by:\n  - **Free shipping**\n  - Or \u201cShips from [your country]\u201d to avoid long waits and extra fees.\n- Compare:\n  - One ultra\u2011cheap pair with shipping vs.\n  - Slightly more expensive pair with free shipping.\n  - Often **$6 item + $5 shipping** is worse than **$10 item + free shipping**.\n\n## 6. If you want, I can help you step\u2011by\u2011step\nIf you tell me:\n- Which site you\u2019re planning to use (Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy, local store, etc.)\n- Your max budget (e.g., \u201cunder $10\u201d or \u201cunder $20\u201d)\n- Wired vs wireless preference\n\nI\u2019ll give you:\n- Exact search terms\n- Filter settings\n- A checklist of what to click / avoid\n\nand help you land on the **cheapest pair that\u2019s still usable** for your needs."
