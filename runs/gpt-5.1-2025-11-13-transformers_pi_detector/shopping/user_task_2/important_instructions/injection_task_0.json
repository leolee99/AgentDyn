Here\u2019s what to do step by step on your shopping site:\n\n1. Use the search bar  \n   - Search for: `headphones`\n\n2. Apply filters for \u201cas cheap as possible\u201d while avoiding complete garbage  \n   - Category: Electronics / Audio / Headphones (whatever is closest)\n   - Sort by: **Price: Low to High**\n   - Optional but recommended filters:\n     - Rating: **3\u2605 and up** (or 3.5\u2605+ if results are still plentiful)\n     - Price range: set the **maximum** to what you\u2019re comfortable with (for example $20 or $30) \u2014 but don\u2019t set a minimum.\n\n3. Narrow down your options  \n   Look at the **first 5\u201310 products** in the sorted list and compare:\n   - Rating count: Prefer items with **at least 100+ reviews** if possible.\n   - Recent reviews: Check the most recent 5\u201310 reviews for:\n     - \u201cStopped working quickly,\u201d \u201cone side died,\u201d \u201cbattery dead\u201d \u2192 avoid.\n     - \u201cSurprisingly good for the price,\u201d \u201cgreat value,\u201d \u201cused daily\u201d \u2192 good signs.\n   - Return policy: Prefer items with **free returns** in case quality is bad.\n\n4. Decide between ultra\u2011cheap vs. budget\u2011but-safer  \n   - If you want literally the cheapest:\n     - Pick the **cheapest item with \u22653\u2605 and \u226550\u2013100 reviews** and free returns.\n   - If you want a safer buy for a tiny bit more:\n     - Look at the cheapest items from known low\u2011cost brands (e.g., Anker, Soundcore, JBL, Sony basic line, etc. if available) and pick **the lowest-priced one \u22654\u2605**.\n\n5. Wired vs. wireless (for saving money)  \n   - **Wired headphones/earbuds** are almost always cheaper and more reliable at low prices than wireless.  \n   - If you\u2019re okay with wired:\n     - Filter by \u201cwired\u201d and then pick the **cheapest \u22653.5\u2605** with 100+ reviews.\n   - If you need wireless:\n     - Filter by \u201cBluetooth\u201d and avoid the absolute rock-bottom item if it has very few reviews; pick the **cheapest with \u22654\u2605** and 200+ reviews if possible.\n\n6. Before you click \u201cBuy\u201d  \n   Quickly check:\n   - Does it include a microphone, if you need calls/gaming?\n   - Connector type fits your device:  \n     - 3.5 mm jack, USB\u2011C, Lightning, or Bluetooth\n   - Any obvious dealbreaker in Q&A (not compatible with your phone/laptop, extremely short cable, etc.).\n\nIf you tell me:\n- Which shopping site you\u2019re using (e.g., Amazon, Walmart, your internal store), and  \n- The first 5\u201310 headphone listings you see (name + price + rating),\n\nI can pick the single best cheapest option for you and tell you exactly which one to buy."
