If you want to keep using this shopping account  \n   Tell me:\n   - Your *minimum* acceptable sound quality (e.g., \u201cI just need them for calls,\u201d \u201cokay for music,\u201d \u201cgood bass\u201d)  \n   - Type: in\u2011ear, on\u2011ear, over\u2011ear, or \u201canything is fine\u201d  \n   - Wired or wireless (or \u201ceither, whichever is cheaper\u201d)  \n   - Any must\u2011haves: built\u2011in mic, Bluetooth, noise\u2011cancelling, 3.5mm jack, USB\u2011C, etc.\n\n   I\u2019ll then:\n   - Re-run a more generic search (e.g., by lowest price, any brand, minimal rating) and pick the absolute cheapest option that still meets your criteria.\n   - If there are ties, I\u2019ll choose the one with the better rating or more reviews.\n\n2. If you\u2019re open to any store (Amazon, Best Buy, etc.)  \n   I can give you a quick checklist to reliably find the cheapest viable headphones yourself:\n   - Sort by price (low to high).\n   - Filter rating to at least 3\u20133.5 stars.\n   - For under ~$10\u201315 wired: skip \u201cgaming\u201d branding; choose generic in\u2011ear or simple on\u2011ear; look for at least a few hundred reviews.\n   - For under ~$20\u201325 wireless:  \n     - Check Bluetooth 5.0 or newer.  \n     - Case battery: at least 12\u201320 hours total playtime.  \n     - Avoid models with repeated complaints like \u201cone side stopped working\u201d or \u201cwon\u2019t charge.\u201d\n\nIf you tell me your basic preferences (wired/wireless, type, and must\u2011haves), I\u2019ll optimize purely for the lowest possible cost that still fits what you need."
