Budget split\n\nTo stay safely under $1,500 (including both items), aim for:\n\n- Laptop: **$1,300 or less**\n- Mouse: **$50 or less** (gives room for tax/shipping)\n- Total target: **\u2264 $1,350\u2013$1,400** before tax/fees\n\nThis gives you a buffer so you don\u2019t exceed $1,500 even with taxes or minor price differences.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Laptop: what to look for (within ~$1,300)\n\nPick based on your main use. Here are specs that are good value under this budget.\n\n### If you want a general-purpose / work laptop\nTarget (Windows):\n\n- **CPU:** AMD Ryzen 5 / Ryzen 7, or Intel Core i5 / i7 (11th gen or newer, or equivalent Ryzen 5000 or newer)\n- **RAM:** At least **16 GB**\n- **Storage:** At least **512 GB SSD**\n- **Display:** 14\"\u201315.6\", Full HD (1920\u00d71080) or better\n- **Battery:** At least rated 8+ hours if possible\n- **Price goal:** **$800\u2013$1,100**\n\n### If you want something for programming / light gaming\n- **CPU:** Ryzen 7 or Intel i7 (or high-end Ryzen 5 / i5)\n- **RAM:** **16 GB** (32 GB if you find a good deal)\n- **Storage:** **512 GB\u20131 TB SSD**\n- **GPU:** Dedicated GPU like NVIDIA RTX 3050 / 4050 or similar (optional but nice for gaming/ML)\n- **Price goal:** **$1,000\u2013$1,300**\n\n### If you want a Mac (and can find a deal)\nLook for **MacBook Air M1 or M2** on sale:\n\n- **RAM:** 8 GB (16 GB if budget allows)\n- **Storage:** 256\u2013512 GB SSD\n- **Price goal:** \n  - M1 Air: often **$700\u2013$900**\n  - M2 Air: often **$900\u2013$1,200**\n\nAs you search, sort/filter by:\n- Category: **Electronics \u2192 Laptops**\n- Price max: **$1,300**\n- Then compare 3\u20135 candidates that match the specs above.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Mouse: what to pick (\u2264 $50)\n\nTypes and price targets:\n\n- **Basic wired mouse:** $10\u2013$20  \n  - Good if you don\u2019t mind a cable.\n- **Wireless office mouse:** $20\u2013$40  \n  - Logitech, Microsoft, etc. Very comfortable for daily use.\n- **Basic gaming mouse:** $30\u2013$50  \n  - Higher DPI, more buttons, usually RGB lighting.\n\nFilters to use:\n- Category: **Electronics \u2192 Mouse / Mice / Accessories**\n- Price max: **$50**\n- Rating: **4 stars or higher**, if you can filter by rating.\n\n---\n\n## 4. How to make sure you stay under $1,500\n\n1. Choose a laptop you like under **$1,300**.\n2. Choose a mouse under **$50**.\n3. Add both to your cart.\n4. Check:\n   - Subtotal of items\n   - Estimated tax / shipping\n\nIf **Total > $1,500**:\n- First, try a slightly cheaper **mouse**.\n- If still over, lower the laptop budget to **$1,150\u2013$1,200** and re-choose.\n\n---\n\n## 5. If you want direct product recommendations\n\nIf you can, paste in:\n- The product names and prices of 3\u20135 laptops you\u2019re considering\n- 2\u20133 mice you\u2019re considering\n\nI\u2019ll:\n- Check that the combinations stay under $1,500\n- Tell you which pair gives the best value for your use (work, study, gaming, programming, etc.)\n- Recommend exactly which laptop + mouse to buy."
