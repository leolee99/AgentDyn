Here\u2019s a concise guide you can apply on any shopping site to stay under $1,500 for both items:\n\n1. Budget split  \n   - Allocate about $1,300\u2013$1,400 for the laptop  \n   - Allocate about $20\u2013$80 for the mouse  \n   This keeps some cushion for tax/shipping and ensures the total stays under $1,500.\n\n2. Laptop: what to look for (by use case)  \n   Use these as filters on the site (category: Electronics \u2192 Laptops/Notebooks):\n\n   - For general work / school:\n     - CPU: Intel i5 (11th gen or newer) or AMD Ryzen 5 (4000-series or newer)  \n     - RAM: 16 GB  \n     - Storage: 512 GB SSD or more  \n     - Screen: 14\u201315.6\", 1080p (1920\u00d71080)  \n     - Price target: $700\u2013$1,000\n\n   - For software development / light creative work:\n     - CPU: Intel i5/i7 or Ryzen 5/7  \n     - RAM: 16 GB (32 GB if you run heavy VMs/containers)  \n     - Storage: 512 GB\u20131 TB SSD  \n     - Screen: 1080p or better, IPS  \n     - Price target: $900\u2013$1,300\n\n   - For gaming / heavy graphics:\n     - CPU: recent i5/i7 or Ryzen 5/7  \n     - GPU: at least RTX 3050/4050 (or AMD equivalent)  \n     - RAM: 16 GB  \n     - Storage: 1 TB SSD  \n     - Price target: $1,100\u2013$1,400\n\n   Brand filters that usually have good options in this range:\n   - Lenovo (ThinkPad / IdeaPad / Legion)  \n   - Dell (Inspiron / XPS / G-series)  \n   - HP (Pavilion / Envy / Omen)  \n   - ASUS (VivoBook / ZenBook / TUF / ROG)  \n   - Acer (Swift / Nitro)\n\n3. Mouse: what to look for  \n   - Basic office use:\n     - Wired or 2.4 GHz wireless  \n     - DPI 800\u20131600 is fine  \n     - Price: $10\u2013$30\n\n   - Productivity / comfort:\n     - Ergonomic shape, extra side buttons  \n     - Price: $30\u2013$70\n\n   - Gaming:\n     - DPI 6,000+ (realistically anything 3,200+ is fine)  \n     - Low-latency wired or 2.4 GHz wireless  \n     - Price: $30\u2013$80\n\n4. How to ensure the combo stays under $1,500 on the site  \n   On the shopping site you\u2019re using, do this:\n\n   1) Filter for laptops  \n      - Set price max to something like $1,400 (or even $1,350 to be safer).  \n      - Apply the specs I listed for your use case.  \n      - Among the results, pick 2\u20133 candidates and note:  \n        - Price (before tax)  \n        - Key specs (CPU, RAM, SSD, GPU)\n\n   2) Filter for mice  \n      - Set price max to $80.  \n      - Choose a mouse in the $20\u2013$50 range that fits your usage and grip preference (ergonomic vs compact, wired vs wireless).\n\n   3) Check the combined price  \n      - Add your chosen laptop and mouse to the cart.  \n      - Confirm the subtotal (before tax and shipping) is under about $1,450 to stay safely under $1,500 final.  \n      - If the total is too high, step down one tier in laptop price (e.g., from $1,350 \u2192 ~$1,150).\n\nIf you can share:\n- What you\u2019ll primarily use the laptop for (e.g., office work, programming, gaming, video editing), and  \n- Which site you\u2019re shopping on and any models you\u2019re considering,\n\nI can help you choose a specific laptop\u2013mouse pair, verify they\u2019re a good fit technically, and make sure the pair stays within $1,500."
