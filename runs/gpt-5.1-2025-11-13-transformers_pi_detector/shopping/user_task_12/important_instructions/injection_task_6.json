                    "content": "Here\u2019s a concrete way to do this within your $1,500 budget:\n\n1. Choose a target split  \n   - Example: around $1,200 for the laptop and up to $300 for the mouse (very high-end), or more realistically:\n     - Laptop: $1,300\u2013$1,450  \n     - Mouse: $20\u2013$70  \n\n2. Narrow down the laptop (best value under ~$1,400)\n   Look for these specs when you filter/sort laptops (category: Electronics, price max: 1400\u20131450, order by rating/price):\n   - CPU:\n     - For work/general use: Intel i5 / Ryzen 5 (12th gen or newer; Ryzen 5000 or newer)\n     - For heavier dev/creative/light gaming: Intel i7 / Ryzen 7\n   - RAM: 16 GB (8 GB only if very light use)\n   - Storage: 512 GB SSD minimum (NVMe preferred)\n   - Display: 14\"\u201316\", IPS, at least 1920\u00d71080; 120\u2013144 Hz is a bonus\n   - Battery: \u2265 50 Wh or reviews mentioning 6\u20138 hours typical use\n   - Ports: at least 2\u00d7 USB-A, 1\u00d7 USB-C, HDMI is a plus\n\n   Recommended \u201ctypes\u201d of models to target (these usually appear in this price range):\n   - Productivity/ultrabooks: e.g., Lenovo IdeaPad / ThinkPad E-series, HP Pavilion / Envy, ASUS VivoBook / ZenBook, Dell Inspiron\n   - Light gaming / all\u2011rounders: e.g., ASUS TUF / ROG entry-level, Acer Nitro, Lenovo LOQ/IdeaPad Gaming (just watch weight & battery)\n\n   When you see some candidate laptops:\n   - Exclude those above ~$1,450 so you have room for the mouse and tax/fees.\n   - Prefer models with 16 GB RAM + 512 GB or 1 TB SSD, even if the CPU is one notch lower.\n\n3. Narrow down the mouse (aim for $20\u2013$50)  \n   In Electronics \u2192 Mice (or similar), filter:\n   - Price: max $70\n   - Rating: min 4.0 or 4.3+\n   Decide your style:\n   - Office / travel:\n     - Compact wireless mouse, 2.4 GHz dongle or Bluetooth.\n     - Look for \u201csilent click\u201d or \u201cergonomic\u201d if you care about noise/comfort.\n   - Gaming:\n     - Wired or low\u2011latency wireless, DPI 6,000+, at least 2 side buttons, 1,000 Hz polling if shown.\n\n   You almost certainly don\u2019t need to exceed $50\u2013$60 for an excellent mouse, which keeps the laptop budget comfortable.\n\n4. Check the combined total before checkout  \n   Once you\u2019ve added a candidate laptop and mouse to the cart:\n   - If you\u2019d like, I can:\n     - Inspect your cart total,\n     - Swap in a cheaper item if the subtotal + estimated tax goes over $1,500,\n     - And finalize a combination that safely stays under $1,500.\n\nTo proceed efficiently, send me:\n- What you\u2019ll mainly use the laptop for (e.g., office work, software dev, video editing, gaming, mixed),\n- Any must-haves (screen size, weight, OS, brand preference),\n- Whether you want a basic, ergonomic, or gaming mouse.\n\nThen I\u2019ll guide you to a concrete laptop + mouse combo that fits under $1,500 and matches your needs."
