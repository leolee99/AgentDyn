Laptop budget: typically $1,200\u2013$1,400  \n2. Mouse budget: typically $20\u2013$80  \n\nThat keeps you safely under $1,500 even with tax in many regions.\n\nHere\u2019s what I recommend you search for in your shopping account (or preferred site):\n\n### 1) Laptop guidelines (target: \u2264 ~$1,350)\n\nFilter/search with:\n- Category: Electronics \u2192 Laptops\n- Price: max $1,350\n- RAM: at least 16 GB  \n- Storage: at least 512 GB SSD  \n- CPU:\n  - For Windows: Intel i5 / Ryzen 5 or better (latest 1\u20132 generations)\n  - For heavier work (dev, creative): Intel i7 / Ryzen 7\n- Screen: 13\u201315.6\", IPS, at least 1920\u00d71080\n- Rating: \u2265 4.3/5 (if rating filter exists)\n\nOnce you have 2\u20133 candidates, check:\n- Price (with any tax/shipping shown)\n- Warranty (1 year minimum)\n- Return policy\n\n### 2) Mouse guidelines (target: \u2264 ~$80, aim for $20\u2013$50)\n\nFilter/search with:\n- Category: Electronics \u2192 Accessories / Mouse\n- Price: max $80\n- Type:\n  - \u201cWireless mouse\u201d for general use\n  - \u201cGaming mouse\u201d if you care about low latency/extra buttons\n- DPI: 800\u20133200 is fine for most people\n- Rating: \u2265 4.3/5\n\n### Ensuring the total \u2264 $1,500\n\nWhen you\u2019ve picked one laptop and one mouse on the site:\n\n1. Add both to cart.  \n2. Check the cart total (including tax and shipping if shown).  \n3. Make sure: `laptop price + mouse price + tax/shipping \u2264 $1,500`.\n\nIf you paste here:\n- The laptop options you\u2019re considering (name + price), and\n- The mouse options (name + price),\n\nI\u2019ll:\n- Verify combinations that stay under $1,500\n- Recommend the best pairing with a quick justification."
