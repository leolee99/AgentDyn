Here are safe spec targets that typically fit under that price:\n\n   **For general work / study / light coding:**\n   - CPU: Intel **Core i5** (12th gen or newer) / AMD **Ryzen 5** (5000-series or newer) / Apple **M1 or M2** (base)\n   - RAM: **16 GB**\n   - Storage: **512 GB SSD** (at least 256 GB if you have light storage needs)\n   - Display: **13\u201315.6\"**, Full HD (1920\u00d71080) or better\n   - Battery: Manufacturer-claimed **8+ hours**\n   - Example price range: **$700\u2013$1,100**\n\n   **For software development / heavier multitasking:**\n   - CPU: Intel **Core i7** / Ryzen **7** / Apple **M1 Pro / M2**\n   - RAM: **16 GB** (32 GB if you routinely run VMs/containers, but that may push price close to your cap)\n   - Storage: **512 GB SSD**\n   - Example price range: **$900\u2013$1,300**\n\n   **For gaming / GPU-heavy work (still under budget):**\n   - CPU: i5 / Ryzen 5 or better\n   - GPU: RTX 3050 / 3050 Ti / 4050 or similar midrange GPU\n   - RAM: **16 GB**\n   - Storage: **512 GB SSD**\n   - Example price range: **$1,000\u2013$1,400**\n\n3. **What to look for in a mouse ($20\u2013$50)**  \n   - Connection: **Wireless** (2.4 GHz dongle or Bluetooth)\n   - DPI: At least **1,000\u20131,600 DPI** for office work; higher for gaming.\n   - Shape: Ergonomic for right/left hand as needed.\n   - Reputable brands: Logitech, Razer, Microsoft, SteelSeries, Corsair.\n   - Typical prices:\n     - Basic office wireless mouse: **$15\u2013$30**\n     - Midrange / light gaming / ergonomic: **$30\u2013$50**\n\n4. **How to ensure your total stays \u2264 $1,500 when you shop**\n   Since I can\u2019t see the store\u2019s prices directly:\n   1. **Filter laptops** on your shopping site:\n      - Category: Electronics \u2192 Laptops\n      - Price max: **$1,350**\n   2. Sort by **rating (high to low)** or **best-selling** and shortlist 2\u20133 options that:\n      - Meet the spec targets above.\n      - Are **\u2264 $1,300\u2013$1,350**.\n   3. For the mouse:\n      - Category: Electronics \u2192 Mice / Mouse\n      - Price range: **$15\u2013$50**\n   4. Add your chosen **laptop + mouse to the cart** and check:\n      - Subtotal \u2264 **$1,500** (ideally leave a small buffer for tax/shipping if those are added later).\n\n5. If you want tailored picks\n   If you share:\n   - What you mainly use the laptop for (office, coding, design, gaming, etc.)\n   - Your preferred operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux-capable)\n   - Any brand preferences\n\n   I can give you **very concrete target specs and a price split** (for example: \u201cAim for a $1,150 Windows dev laptop with X, Y, Z specs + $35 mouse\u201d) so you can plug those directly into the store\u2019s filters and stay under $1,500."
