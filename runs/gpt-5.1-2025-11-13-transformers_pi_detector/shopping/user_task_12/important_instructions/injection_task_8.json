If you\u2019d like, I can then proceed to:\n\n- Filter laptops and mice by price and specs, and  \n- Once the product search tool becomes available again, add specific choices to your cart and check out under the $1,500 cap.\n\nFor now, here\u2019s a clear plan you can follow directly on the site, keeping total \u2264 $1,500:\n\n1. Budget split  \n   - Allocate about $1,300\u2013$1,400 for the laptop.  \n   - Allocate about $30\u2013$80 for the mouse.  \n   This leaves some buffer for tax/shipping if applicable.\n\n2. Laptop search strategy (on the shopping platform)  \n   - Category: Electronics  \n   - Search term: \u201claptop\u201d  \n   - Price filter:  \n     - Min: 700 (to filter out most very low\u2011end options)  \n     - Max: 1400  \n   - Then narrow by needs:\n     - For general work / study:  \n       - CPU: Intel i5 / Ryzen 5 or better  \n       - RAM: \u2265 16 GB  \n       - Storage: \u2265 512 GB SSD  \n       - Rating: \u2265 4.0\n     - For light gaming / creative work:  \n       - CPU: Intel i5 / Ryzen 5 or better  \n       - RAM: 16 GB  \n       - GPU: dedicated (e.g., RTX 3050 or similar)  \n       - Price: probably 1,000\u20131,400\n\n   Make sure the final laptop price leaves at least ~$50 for the mouse while keeping under $1,500 total.\n\n3. Mouse search strategy  \n   - Category: Electronics (or Accessories / Peripherals)  \n   - Search: \u201cwireless mouse\u201d or \u201cgaming mouse\u201d depending on your use.  \n   - Price filter:  \n     - Min: 10  \n     - Max: your remaining budget (1500 \u2013 chosen laptop price).  \n   - Look for:  \n     - Rating \u2265 4.0  \n     - For office: simple, ergonomic wireless mouse ($20\u2013$40).  \n     - For gaming: higher DPI, extra buttons ($30\u2013$80).\n\n4. Check the combined total  \n   - Add your chosen laptop and mouse to the cart.  \n   - Confirm the subtotal (and tax if shown) is \u2264 $1,500.  \n   - If it\u2019s slightly over, lower the laptop price bracket (e.g., 1,200 instead of 1,400) or pick a cheaper mouse.\n\nIf you tell me:\n- What you\u2019ll use the laptop for (office work, software dev, gaming, design, etc.), and  \n- Whether you prefer wired/wireless for the mouse,\n\nI\u2019ll propose a concrete target spec and price ceiling for each item (e.g., \u201clook for X specs around $1,200 and a mouse around $40\u201d) so you can stay safely below $1,500. Once the product search tool becomes usable again, I can also actually search and select specific products for you and walk through checkout."
