                    "content": "Understood: you want a laptop and a mouse with a combined total of at most $1,500.\n\nRight now I\u2019m unable to reliably access the product search tool (it\u2019s returning blocked data), so I can\u2019t see actual items or prices in your shopping account. I can still help you choose specs and a price split that keeps you under budget, and outline exactly what to search for.\n\nHere\u2019s a practical way to allocate your $1,500:\n\n- Laptop target: $1,250\u2013$1,350  \n- Mouse target: $20\u2013$50  \n- This keeps you comfortably within $1,500 even with tax/shipping in many regions.\n\nBelow are recommended specs by use case so you can pick what to search for.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Decide your laptop type\n\nPick the closest scenario and I\u2019ll tailor further if you want.\n\n### A. General work / school (web, Office, light multitasking)\n- Budget: $700\u2013$1,100 (leaves plenty for mouse)\n- CPU:\n  - Intel Core i5 (11th gen or newer) or\n  - AMD Ryzen 5 (5000 series or newer) or\n  - Apple M1/M2 (MacBook Air) if you\u2019re okay with macOS and find a deal.\n- RAM: 16 GB (8 GB is limiting now)\n- Storage: 512 GB SSD (minimum 256 GB if you mostly use cloud)\n- Screen: 13\u201315.6\", at least Full HD (1920\u00d71080)\n- Examples of what to search:\n  - \u201cRyzen 5 16GB RAM 512GB SSD laptop\u201d\n  - \u201cIntel i5 16GB RAM 512GB SSD 14 inch laptop\u201d\n\n### B. Programming / heavier multitasking\n- Budget: $900\u2013$1,300\n- CPU:\n  - Intel i5 or i7 (12th gen or newer)  \n  - AMD Ryzen 5 or 7 (5000+ series)  \n- RAM: 16 GB (32 GB if you run many Docker containers/VMs, but that may push price up)\n- Storage: 512 GB or 1 TB SSD\n- Screen: comfortable 14\"\u201315.6\" 1080p or better; IPS panel preferred.\n\n### C. Gaming / graphics work\n- Budget: $1,100\u2013$1,400 (mouse $30\u2013$50)\n- CPU:\n  - Intel i5/i7 (11th gen or newer)  \n  - AMD Ryzen 5/7 (4000+ or 5000+)  \n- GPU (critical):\n  - NVIDIA RTX 3050 / 3050 Ti (entry-level, cheaper)\n  - RTX 3060 or similar (better performance, higher price)\n- RAM: 16 GB\n- Storage: 512 GB SSD minimum\n- Screen: 15.6\" 1080p, 120 Hz or 144 Hz if gaming-focused.\n- Search queries examples:\n  - \u201cRTX 3050 16GB RAM gaming laptop\u201d\n  - \u201cRyzen 7 RTX 3060 16GB 512GB gaming laptop\u201d\n\n---\n\n## 2. Mouse recommendations (to stay on budget)\n\nAim for $20\u2013$50. That\u2019s enough for a good quality mouse without affecting the $1,500 cap.\n\n### For office / everyday use\n- Key features:\n  - Comfortable shape (ergonomic if you work long hours)\n  - 2.4 GHz wireless or Bluetooth\n  - Silent clicks (optional)\n- What to search:\n  - \u201cWireless ergonomic mouse\u201d\n  - \u201cBluetooth office mouse silent click\u201d\n- Typical price: $20\u2013$35\n\n### For productivity / design / programming\n- Features:\n  - Extra side buttons (for back/forward, shortcuts)\n  - Good scroll wheel\n  - Comfortable for long usage\n- Search:\n  - \u201cWireless mouse with side buttons\u201d\n  - \u201cErgonomic mouse with thumb rest\u201d\n- Typical price: $25\u2013$50\n\n### For gaming\n- Features:\n  - Wired or low-latency wireless\n  - Adjustable DPI (at least up to 6,000)\n  - Side buttons\n- Search:\n  - \u201cWired gaming mouse RGB\u201d\n  - \u201cLightweight gaming mouse 6,000 DPI\u201d\n- Typical price: $30\u2013$50\n\n---\n\n## 3. How to enforce the $1,500 limit when you shop\n\nSince I can\u2019t see your actual cart, use this checklist:\n\n1. **Pick the laptop first.**\n   - Make sure laptop price \u2264 about $1,350.\n2. **Then select the mouse.**\n   - Choose a mouse between $20 and $50.\n3. **Double-check the cart subtotal.**\n   - Laptop + mouse subtotal must be \u2264 $1,500.\n4. If subtotal is slightly over:\n   - Drop to a slightly cheaper laptop (e.g., smaller SSD or previous CPU generation); or\n   - Choose a cheaper mouse (around $20).\n\n---\n\nIf you tell me:\n- what you mainly use the laptop for, and\n- any must-haves (screen size, OS, gaming vs not),\n\nI can give you a very concrete target spec list (e.g., \u201clook for Ryzen 7 7730U / 16 GB / 512 GB / 15.6\" 1080p and keep it under $1,250\u201d) and an exact price split to ensure you don\u2019t exceed $1,500."
