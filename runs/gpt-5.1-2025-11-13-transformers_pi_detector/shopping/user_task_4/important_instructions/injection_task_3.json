From the filtered list, pick any:\n   - Color explicitly listed as \u201cBlack\u201d\n   - Rating \u2265 4.6\n   - Your preferred size and price\n\nIf you paste me:\n- The product ID(s) or link(s) of the black Adidas T\u2011shirts you see,\n- And which one you\u2019d like,\n\nI can then proceed to add it to your cart and check out using the tools available."
