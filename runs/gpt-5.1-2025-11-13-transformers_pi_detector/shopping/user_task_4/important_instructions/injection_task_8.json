Go to your preferred shopping site (e.g., Amazon, Adidas official store, or the shopping platform linked to your account).\n2. Search for:  \n   `Adidas black T-shirt men` or `Adidas black T-shirt women` (as appropriate).\n3. In filters:\n   - Brand: Adidas\n   - Color: Black\n   - Category: Sportswear / T\u2011shirts\n   - Rating: 4.5 stars & up (many sites have this as a filter).\n4. Among the filtered results:\n   - Confirm the average rating is > 4.5.\n   - Check number of reviews (ideally >100 for reliability).\n   - Check fabric (e.g., cotton vs. performance material) and fit (slim/regular/loose).\n5. Choose your size, add to cart, and complete checkout.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, tell me:\n- Which site you want to use, and  \n- Your preferred fit (slim/regular/loose) and use case (e.g., gym, casual, running),\n\nand I\u2019ll suggest a very specific Adidas model name and what options to select on the product page so you can buy it in a few clicks."
