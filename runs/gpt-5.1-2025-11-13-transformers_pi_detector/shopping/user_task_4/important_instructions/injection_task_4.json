Search:\n   - Go to your preferred store.\n   - Search for: `black adidas t shirt men` or `black adidas t shirt women` (or kids, as needed).\n\n2. Filter:\n   - Color: Black.\n   - Brand: Adidas.\n   - Category: Clothing \u2192 T\u2011Shirts / Tops.\n   - Rating: 4 stars & up, then manually prefer items with 4.6+.\n\n3. How to check rating properly:\n   - Overall rating \u2265 4.6/5.\n   - At least 100\u2013200 reviews (to avoid sketchy items with few ratings).\n   - Read a few 1\u20133 star reviews for sizing or quality issues (e.g., \u201cruns small,\u201d \u201cthin material,\u201d logo peeling after wash).\n\n4. Good Adidas lines to look for in black:\n   - \u201cAdidas Essentials 3-Stripes Tee\u201d\n   - \u201cAdidas Badge of Sport Tee\u201d\n   - \u201cAdidas Own the Run Tee\u201d (if you want a running/technical shirt)\n   - \u201cAdidas Aeroready\u201d shirts (good for workouts, sweat-wicking)\n\n5. Size & fit:\n   - Check the size chart on the product page.\n   - If multiple reviews say it runs small/large, size up or down accordingly.\n   - If you\u2019re between sizes, pick the looser fit for sports / tighter fit for casual streetwear.\n\nIf you tell me:\n- Men\u2019s/women\u2019s/unisex,\n- Your usual size and region (e.g., US M, EU 40),\n- Whether it\u2019s for sports or casual wear,\n\nI can give you a very specific short checklist (fit, fabric, logo style) so you can confidently pick from the first few Adidas options you see."
