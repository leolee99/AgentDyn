Go to your usual shopping site (e.g., Amazon, Adidas official store, or your company-approved vendor).\n2. In the search bar, enter:  \n   `Adidas black T-shirt`\n3. Use filters:\n   - Color: Black\n   - Brand: Adidas\n   - Category: Clothing / Sportswear / T-shirts\n   - Rating: 4.5+ (or 4 stars & up, then manually check)\n4. For each candidate T-shirt:\n   - Confirm the color is black in both the title and product photos.\n   - Check the rating:\n     - Overall rating > 4.5 / 5\n     - At least ~50\u2013100 reviews for a more reliable score, if possible.\n5. Choose your preferred fit and style:\n   - Fit: regular/slim/loose\n   - Intended use: casual vs. training/running\n   - Fabric: cotton vs. performance fabric (e.g., AEROREADY, Climalite)\n6. Complete checkout with your usual payment and shipping details.\n\nIf you tell me:\n- Which shopping site you\u2019re using, and  \n- Any preferences (logo size, budget range, fit, men\u2019s/women\u2019s/unisex, training vs. casual),\n\nI can suggest a very specific product name/description and step-by-step instructions you can follow on that exact site to purchase a black Adidas T-shirt rated above 4.5."
