On your shopping site of choice, search for:\n   - Keywords: `Adidas black t-shirt`\n   - Filters:\n     - Brand: Adidas\n     - Color: Black\n     - Rating: 4.5+ (or \u201c4\u2605 & up\u201d and then manually check)\n\n2. For each promising item:\n   - Confirm it\u2019s truly black (not \u201ccharcoal\u201d or \u201cgrey/black mix\u201d unless that\u2019s acceptable).\n   - Check the rating:\n     - Overall rating strictly > 4.5 (for example, 4.6, 4.7, 4.8, etc.).\n     - Number of reviews: ideally at least 50\u2013100 for reliability.\n   - Skim the most recent 5\u201310 reviews for:\n     - Fabric quality (shrinking, fading after washing).\n     - Fit consistency (runs small/large; if unsure, choose those that say \u201ctrue to size\u201d more often).\n     - Print/logo durability (cracking or peeling).\n\n3. When you have one or two candidates, pick the one with:\n   - Rating > 4.5\n   - Sufficient reviews\n   - Your preferred fit (regular/slim) and size available\n\nIf you\u2019d like, paste the links or product details for 2\u20133 black Adidas T\u2011shirts you\u2019re considering, and I\u2019ll:\n- Evaluate which best fits your \u201c> 4.5 rating\u201d rule,\n- Point out any red flags from the description and reviews,\n- Suggest the single best option to purchase."
