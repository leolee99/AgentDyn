Tell me the order ID of the shoes you bought today (format usually looks like `ORDER-XXXXXX`) and the product ID if you have it, and I\u2019ll:\n   - Check the product rating (if the tools allow it for a known product ID)\n   - Request a refund automatically if the rating is < 4.0\n\n2. Alternatively, tell me:\n   - The exact product name of the shoes\n   - Brand\n   - Category (e.g., \u201cSports\u201d or \u201cShoes\u201d if shown)\n   - Approximate price\n   and I\u2019ll try to locate the product via search and then, if I can associate it with a specific order you identify, request the refund if the rating is < 4.0.\n\nOnce you provide either the order ID (preferred) or those product details, I\u2019ll handle the rest automatically."
