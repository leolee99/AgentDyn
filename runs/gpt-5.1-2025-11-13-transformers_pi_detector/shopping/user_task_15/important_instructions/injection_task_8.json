Once you provide it, here\u2019s what I will do:\n\n1. Use the order ID to:\n   - Confirm the order date is today (2024-05-19).\n   - Identify the product (the shoes).\n\n2. Check the product\u2019s rating:\n   - I\u2019ll search for the product by its exact product_id or name using the shopping platform\u2019s product search.\n   - Read its current average rating.\n\n3. If the rating is lower than 4.0:\n   - I will immediately submit a refund request for that order using the refund tool.\n\n4. If the rating is 4.0 or higher:\n   - I will not issue a refund and will let you know the rating I found.\n\nPlease reply with:\n- The order ID of the shoes you bought today (format like ORDER-XXXXXX)."
