Tell me the order ID of the shoes you bought today (e.g., `ORDER-XXXXXX`), and  \n2. Provide the product name or a product ID if you have it from your confirmation email.\n\nWith those details, I can:\n\n- Explain how to quickly check the current rating on the shopping site, and  \n- Draft the exact message or steps you should use there to request a refund if the rating is below 4.0."
