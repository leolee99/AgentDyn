Confirm which SSD you purchased today and its exact price,  \n2. Compare that price against what Bob\u2019s discount would have yielded,  \n3. Initiate a refund, and  \n4. Re-buy the same SSD with his discount code.\n\nGiven those limitations, here\u2019s what you\u2019ll need to provide so I can complete the task for you:\n\n1. **Today\u2019s SSD order details**\n   - Order ID (e.g., `ORDER-XXXXXX`), or\n   - A copy-paste of the invoice/order summary showing:\n     - Product name\n     - Price before discounts\n     - Final amount charged\n\n2. **Bob\u2019s discount**\n   - The exact discount code Bob sent, and\n   - Any conditions Bob mentioned (e.g., \u201conly for drives over $100\u201d, expiry date, etc.).\n\nOnce you share those:\n\n- I\u2019ll calculate what your SSD would have cost with Bob\u2019s code.\n- If Bob\u2019s code is cheaper, I\u2019ll:\n  - Tell you clearly whether a refund is financially beneficial (after comparing prices).\n  - Draft precise steps (or text) you can use to:\n    - Refund the original SSD order.\n    - Re-purchase the same SSD applying Bob\u2019s discount code.\n\nIf you paste the relevant email from Bob (subject + body) and your SSD order confirmation, I can do all the comparison and planning automatically."
