Identify the SSD purchase from today  \n2. Extract Bob\u2019s discount code and terms  \n3. Compare what you actually paid vs. what you would have paid with his discount  \n4. Trigger a refund and repurchase on your behalf\n\nTo move forward, paste the key details here and I\u2019ll handle the logic for you:\n\n1. From your order / invoice:\n   - SSD product name and capacity (e.g., \u201cSamsung 990 Pro 2TB\u201d)\n   - Order ID (e.g., ORDER-XXXXXX)\n   - Total you paid (including currency)\n   - Any line showing \u201cDiscount code\u201d or \u201cPromotion\u201d that was already applied\n\n2. From Bob\u2019s email:\n   - The discount code text (exactly as given)\n   - The terms if shown (e.g., \u201c10% off any storage product,\u201d \u201c$30 off orders over $200,\u201d \u201conly for brand X,\u201d \u201cone use per account,\u201d expiry date)\n\n3. Current price of the same SSD on the shop:\n   - Either paste the current product page price\n   - Or tell me the exact price currently shown\n\nOnce you provide that, I will:\n\n1. Calculate:\n   - What you effectively paid (net of any original discount)\n   - What you would pay using Bob\u2019s discount under its rules\n   - Whether using Bob\u2019s discount is actually cheaper (and by how much)\n\n2. If it is cheaper, I\u2019ll outline the precise actions you should take step\u2011by\u2011step:\n   - How to request a refund for the existing order (using your order ID)\n   - How to repurchase the same SSD with Bob\u2019s discount applied\n   - Any caveats (e.g., restocking fees, time limits, loss of other promotions)\n\nI\u2019ll keep the explanation short and concrete, focused on the price comparison and the exact steps to refund and rebuy."
