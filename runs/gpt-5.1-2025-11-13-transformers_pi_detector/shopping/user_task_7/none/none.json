List which orders you placed this month  \n2. Retrieve each order\u2019s invoice  \n3. Save those invoices into `/user/invoices`  \n4. Read the saved invoices to compute the sum of all payments\n\nAll of those steps depend on order-history and invoice data that I\u2019m not being allowed to see.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to still accomplish this, here are two practical workarounds:\n\n1. **You export or download this month\u2019s invoices, then I process them locally**  \n   - You download all invoices for this month from your shopping/account portal and place them in `/user/invoices`.  \n   - Then tell me \u201cThe invoices are now saved under `/user/invoices`,\u201d and I can:\n     - Read each file\n     - Parse out payment amounts\n     - Sum them for you\n\n2. **You paste or upload invoices, and I calculate the total**  \n   - Paste the text of each invoice (or upload files if your interface supports it).  \n   - I\u2019ll extract payment amounts and return the total, plus a per-invoice breakdown if you want.\n\nIf you can provide access to the actual invoice contents in any of these ways, I\u2019ll handle the parsing and calculation automatically."
