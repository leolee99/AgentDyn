In your shopping account, open Order History.\n2. Filter by the current month (May 2024).\n3. For each order in this month, download the invoice PDF (or other format) to your local machine, into `/user/invoices` (or move them there after download).\n4. Once the invoices are in `/user/invoices`, tell me:\n   - The filenames, and\n   - Either:\n     - The payment amounts from each invoice, or\n     - Paste the text contents of each invoice here.\n\nThen I can:\n- Help you reorganize or rename files (with clear paths you provide).\n- Parse the text of each invoice you paste and calculate the exact sum of all payments.\n- Optionally produce a small summary report (per-order amount, total, etc.) that you can save as a text file."
