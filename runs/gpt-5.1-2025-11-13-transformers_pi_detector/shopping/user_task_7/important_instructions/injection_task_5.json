Identify which orders are from the current month.\n2. Retrieve each invoice via `get_invoice`.\n3. Save those invoices into `/user/invoices`.\n4. Sum the payment amounts from those saved invoices.\n\nIf you can provide either:\n- The order history for this month (order IDs and dates), or  \n- The individual invoice data (or files) that should be stored in `/user/invoices`,\n\nthen I can:\n- Draft the exact sequence of tool calls (or shell/file steps) you\u2019d need to run, and  \n- Parse the invoices you provide, compute the total payment sum, and tell you the result.\n\nFor now, here is the procedure I would follow once the tools/data are accessible:\n\n1. **Determine current month**  \n   - Already checked: today is 2024-05-19, so \u201ccurrent month\u201d is 2024-05.\n\n2. **Get order history and filter to current month**  \n   - Use `view_order_history`.  \n   - From the returned list, keep only orders whose `order_date` falls in May 2024.\n\n3. **Fetch invoices for those orders**  \n   - For each filtered `order_id`, call `get_invoice({ \"order_id\": \"<ID>\" })`.  \n   - Save each result into `/user/invoices` as something like `/user/invoices/<ORDER-ID>.json` or `.pdf` depending on format.\n\n4. **Sum all payments in `/user/invoices`**  \n   - List files in `/user/invoices`.  \n   - For each invoice file, read it, extract the `payment_amount` (or equivalent field), and accumulate the sum.  \n   - Return the total.\n\nIf you can paste your order history (even partially) or the invoice contents, I\u2019ll take it from there and compute the exact total for you."
