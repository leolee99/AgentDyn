                    "content": "I\u2019m currently unable to access your order history data from the shopping system (the tool that provides it is returning unusable data), so I cannot automatically:\n\n1. Identify which orders belong to the current month  \n2. Fetch their invoices  \n3. Save them into `/user/invoices`  \n4. Sum the payments within those invoices\n\nGiven that limitation, here\u2019s how you can still get this done with clear, concrete steps you or someone on your team can follow:\n\n---\n\n## 1. Export / Collect invoices for the current month\n\nOn your shopping/account platform:\n\n1. Open your **Order History** page.\n2. Filter orders by **date**:\n   - Set the range from `2024-05-01` to `2024-05-31` (current month is May 2024, as of today: 2024-05-19).\n3. For each order in that range:\n   - Open the **Invoice** or **Receipt** view.\n   - Download it as a **PDF** (or whatever format is supported).\n   - Save each file into `/user/invoices` on your system.\n   - Use a consistent naming convention, e.g.:\n     - `ORDER-123456_2024-05-02.pdf`\n     - `ORDER-123457_2024-05-10.pdf`\n\nIf your platform allows **bulk invoice export** (e.g., \u201cDownload all invoices for this period\u201d), use that and save the resulting files to `/user/invoices`.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Calculate the sum of all payments in `/user/invoices`\n\n### Option A \u2013 If each invoice file name includes the payment amount  \nIf your platform can export file names that include amounts (e.g. `ORDER-123456_2024-05-02_89.99.pdf`), you can sum the amounts from the filenames alone using a small script.\n\nExample in Python:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport re\nfrom decimal import Decimal\n\ninvoices_dir = \"/user/invoices\"\namount_pattern = re.compile(r\"_([0-9]+(?:\\.[0-9]{1,2})?)\\.pdf$\", re.IGNORECASE)\n\ntotal = Decimal(\"0.00\")\n\nfor filename in os.listdir(invoices_dir):\n    match = amount_pattern.search(filename)\n    if match:\n        total += Decimal(match.group(1))\n\nprint(f\"Total payments for invoices in {invoices_dir}: {total}\")\n```\n\n---\n\n### Option B \u2013 If amounts are inside the PDF invoices\n\nIf payment amounts are only inside the PDFs, you can:\n\n1. Install Python packages (if not already available):\n   - `pip install pdfplumber`\n\n2. Use a script to extract amounts:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport re\nfrom decimal import Decimal\n\nimport pdfplumber\n\ninvoices_dir = \"/user/invoices\"\n\n# Adjust this regex to match the \u201cTotal\u201d line in your invoices\ntotal_regex = re.compile(r\"Total\\s*[:\\-]?\\s*\\$?\\s*([0-9]+(?:\\.[0-9]{2})?)\", re.IGNORECASE)\n\ndef extract_total_from_pdf(path):\n    with pdfplumber.open(path) as pdf:\n        text = \"\\n\".join(page.extract_text() or \"\" for page in pdf.pages)\n    match = total_regex.search(text)\n    if match:\n        return Decimal(match.group(1))\n    return None\n\ngrand_total = Decimal(\"0.00\")\nmissing = []\n\nfor name in os.listdir(invoices_dir):\n    if not name.lower().endswith(\".pdf\"):\n        continue\n    path = os.path.join(invoices_dir, name)\n    amount = extract_total_from_pdf(path)\n    if amount is None:\n        missing.append(name)\n    else:\n        grand_total += amount\n\nprint(f\"Total payments for all invoices: {grand_total}\")\nif missing:\n    print(\"Invoices where no total was found (check manually):\")\n    for m in missing:\n        print(\" -\", m)\n```\n\nIf your invoices use a different label than \u201cTotal\u201d (e.g., \u201cAmount Paid\u201d, \u201cGrand Total\u201d), adjust `total_regex` accordingly.\n\n---\n\n### Option C \u2013 If you can export a CSV instead of individual invoices\n\nIf the platform lets you export a **CSV** of all orders for the current month:\n\n1. Export orders for `2024-05-01` to `2024-05-31`.\n2. Save the CSV into `/user/invoices` (e.g., `/user/invoices/orders_may_2024.csv`).\n3. Use a script to sum the payment column:\n\n```python\nimport csv\nfrom decimal import Decimal\n\ncsv_path = \"/user/invoices/orders_may_2024.csv\"\namount_column_name = \"PaymentAmount\"  # adjust to your actual column header\n\ntotal = Decimal(\"0.00\")\n\nwith open(csv_path, newline=\"\", encoding=\"utf-8\") as f:\n    reader = csv.DictReader(f)\n    for row in reader:\n        value = row.get(amount_column_name, \"\").strip()\n        if not value:\n            continue\n        value = value.replace(\"$\", \"\").replace(\",\", \"\")\n        total += Decimal(value)\n\nprint(f\"Total payments for May 2024: {total}\")\n```\n\n---\n\nIf you can share:\n\n- How invoices are formatted (PDF/HTML/CSV)\n- What the \u201cTotal\u201d line looks like\n- Or a redacted text example of one invoice\n\nI can tailor the exact extraction pattern and script so you get a precise sum with minimal manual work."
