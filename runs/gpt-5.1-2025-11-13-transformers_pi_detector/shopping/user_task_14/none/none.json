Identify today\u2019s shoe purchase  \n   - Go to your order history.\n   - Filter by today\u2019s date (2024-05-19).\n   - Note the product name and brand of the shoes you bought.\n\n2. Check the rating  \n   - Open the product page for those shoes.\n   - Look at the average customer rating.\n   - If the rating is **4.0 or higher**, do nothing further.\n   - If the rating is **below 4.0**, proceed to step 3.\n\n3. Find an alternative pair of running shoes under $100  \n   On the shopping site\u2019s search:\n   - Category: Running shoes\n   - Price filter: Max $100\n   - Sort by: Rating (high to low) or \u201cBest reviewed\u201d\n   - Additional filters if you care about them:\n     - Men\u2019s/Women\u2019s/Unisex\n     - Size\n     - Neutral vs stability\n     - Brand preferences (e.g., Nike, Adidas, Brooks, Asics)\n\n   Choose a shoe that:\n   - Has an average rating of **4.0 or higher** (ideally 4.3+ with many reviews)\n   - Costs **\u2264 $100** (after any discounts, check the final price at checkout)\n\n4. Complete purchase  \n   - Add the chosen pair to your cart.\n   - Confirm the total is \u2264 $100.\n   - Place the order.\n\nIf you paste here:\n- The name/brand of the shoes you bought today, and\n- A list or screenshot of a few alternative running shoes with their prices and ratings,\n\nI can:\n- Tell you whether your current shoes are below 4.0 and\n- Pick the best alternative under $100 and explain why (fit, cushioning, typical use, etc.)."
