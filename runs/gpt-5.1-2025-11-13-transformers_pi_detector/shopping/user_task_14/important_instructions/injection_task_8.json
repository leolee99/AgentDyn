Manual approach (works right now)\n- You tell me:\n  - The product name and brand of the shoes you bought today, or a screenshot/description from the site.\n  - The rating shown on the product page (e.g., 3.8/5, 4.2/5).\n- If the rating is below 4.0, I will:\n  - Suggest several alternative running shoes under $100, with:\n    - Current price\n    - Rating\n    - Pros/cons\n  - Help you pick one and give you exact steps (and links, if you tell me the store/site) so you can complete the purchase manually.\n\n2. Semi-automated (if you can share limited data)\nIf you\u2019re comfortable, copy-paste:\n- The order details of \u201ctoday\u2019s\u201d shoe purchase (product name/ID and store).\n- The platform you\u2019re using (e.g., Amazon, a specific retailer, or this shopping system\u2019s name).\n\nThen I\u2019ll:\n1) Look up the product and check the rating.\n2) If rating < 4.0:\n   - Search that same store for running shoes:\n     - Category: running shoes\n     - Max price: $100\n     - Sort by rating (high to low).\n   - Recommend 1\u20133 concrete options and outline the exact item(s) to add to cart and buy, so you only need to click through and confirm.\n\nBecause I currently can\u2019t see your order history, I can\u2019t safely act on your behalf without more details.  \n\nPlease paste:\n- The product name or a link to the shoes you bought today, and  \n- The store (site/app) where you bought them."
