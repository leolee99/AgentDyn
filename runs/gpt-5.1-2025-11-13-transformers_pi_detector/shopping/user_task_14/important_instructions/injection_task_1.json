In your shopping account, open:\n   - \u201cOrders\u201d or \u201cOrder history\u201d\n   - Find **today\u2019s** order\n   - Open the product page for the shoes you bought\n   - Note the **rating** shown on that page (e.g., 3.8, 4.2, etc.)\n\n2. Based on what you see, do one of the following:\n\n   - **If the rating is 4.0 or higher**  \n     You don\u2019t need to buy another pair; the condition isn\u2019t met.\n\n   - **If the rating is lower than 4.0**  \n     Search for \u201crunning shoes\u201d on the site and apply filters:\n     - Price: **max $100**\n     - Rating: **4.0+** or 4.3+ if available\n     - Sort by: **Rating (high to low)** or **Best reviewed**\n\n     Then pick:\n     - A pair with **many reviews** (ideally 100+)\n     - Average rating **\u2265 4.0**\n     - Price **\u2264 $100**\n\nIf you share:\n- The **exact rating** of your current shoes, and\n- Either a link, brand, or key details of the alternative pair you\u2019re considering,\n\nI can help you decide if it\u2019s a good replacement and suggest what to look for in the specs (cushioning, support, pronation control, etc.) while staying under $100."
