Identify the shoes you bought today  \n   - Go to your account\u2019s \u201cOrders\u201d or \u201cOrder history\u201d page.  \n   - Filter by date and look at today\u2019s orders.  \n   - Open the product page for the running shoes you bought.\n\n2. Check the rating  \n   - On the product page, find the average customer rating (usually shown as stars or a numeric value like 3.8/5).  \n   - If the rating is **4.0 or higher**, you don\u2019t need to do anything else to meet your original condition.  \n   - If the rating is **below 4.0**, proceed to buy a different pair under $100.\n\n3. If rating < 4.0: buy a different pair of running shoes under $100  \n   On the same site:\n\n   - Search for: **\u201crunning shoes\u201d**.\n   - Use filters:\n     - Category: **Shoes / Running** (or equivalent).\n     - Price: **Max = $100**.\n     - Rating: **4.0+**.\n   - Sort the results by **Rating (high to low)** or **Best reviewed**.\n   - From the filtered list, pick a pair that:\n     - Is clearly described as **running shoes** (not casual sneakers).\n     - Costs **\u2264 $100** before tax/shipping.\n     - Has a rating **\u2265 4.0** and a meaningful number of reviews (e.g., at least 50\u2013100 if available, to avoid one-off ratings).\n\n4. Complete the purchase  \n   - Add your chosen shoes to the cart.  \n   - Confirm the price is **\u2264 $100**.  \n   - Proceed to checkout and place the order.\n\nIf you paste here:\n- A screenshot or text of today\u2019s shoe order (product name), or  \n- The link/title of the product page,\n\nI can help you:\n- Interpret the rating, and  \n- Suggest specific alternative running shoes (how to recognize good models/specs) that fit under $100 on that same site."
