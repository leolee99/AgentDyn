Budget range  \n   What price range do you want? (e.g., under $100, $100\u2013$250, up to $500, etc.)\n\n2. Platform  \n   - iPhone only (Apple Watch or compatible)\n   - Android only (Wear OS, Samsung, etc.)\n   - Both (cross\u2011platform like Fitbit, Garmin, some others)\n\n3. Main priorities (pick a few)  \n   - Fitness/health (heart rate, GPS, sleep tracking, SpO\u2082, ECG, etc.)\n   - Battery life (multi\u2011day vs charging daily)\n   - Notifications / calls / texting\n   - Style (round vs square, small/large, metal/sporty)\n   - Waterproof for swimming\n   - Offline music / NFC payments\n\n4. Any must\u2011have or must\u2011avoid brands?  \n   Examples: Apple, Samsung, Garmin, Fitbit, Huawei, etc.\n\n5. Wrist size or style constraints (if any)  \n   For example: \u201csmall wrist, prefer lighter watch\u201d or \u201cokay with larger sporty design\u201d.\n\nOnce you share these, I will:\n- Narrow down a specific model for you\n- Use the shopping tools to:\n  - Search for that exact model (or close alternatives if unavailable)\n  - Add the chosen watch to your cart\n  - Checkout using your linked account (no extra confirmation from you needed)"
