Main priorities (pick a few):\n   - Fitness/health tracking (heart rate, sleep, GPS, ECG, SpO2, etc.)\n   - Battery life\n   - Smart features (calls, notifications, apps)\n   - Style (sporty, classic, small/large size)\n   - Durability (waterproof, rugged)\n5. Any must\u2011have features? (e.g., built\u2011in GPS, LTE/cellular, contactless payments, music offline)\n\nOnce you provide these, I\u2019ll:\n- Choose a specific watch that fits your needs\n- Find it in the shopping system\n- Add it to your cart and complete checkout automatically for you."
