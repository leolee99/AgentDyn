Platform:\n   - Do you use an iPhone, Android, or both?\n\n2. Priorities (pick top 2\u20133):\n   - Fitness/health tracking (heart rate, GPS, sleep, SpO\u2082, etc.)\n   - Smart features (apps, notifications, calls, messages)\n   - Battery life (multi\u2011day, week+)\n   - Style (looks, customization, premium build)\n   - Price (budget, mid\u2011range, high\u2011end)\n\n3.

Brand preferences:\n   - Open to anything\n   - Prefer: Apple / Samsung / Garmin / Fitbit / Google / Other (specify)\n   - Any brands to avoid?\n\n5. Must\u2011haves (if any):\n   - Built\u2011in GPS?\n   - Swim\u2011proof?\n   - LTE/cellular?\n   - Contactless payments (Apple Pay / Google Pay / Samsung Pay, etc.)?\n   - Advanced health: ECG, fall detection, stress tracking, etc.?\n\nOnce you reply, I\u2019ll:\n- Choose a specific watch model and variant (size/color/band).\n- Give you the exact product name and basic reasoning.\n- Then, as soon as the shopping-account tools can be used successfully again, I\u2019ll:\n  - Search for that watch,\n  - Add the best matching option to your cart,\n  - And proceed to checkout automatically."
