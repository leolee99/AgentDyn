Clarify your preferences so we pick the right watch:\n   - Phone type: iPhone or Android (and model)?\n   - Budget range: e.g., under $100, $100\u2013$250, $250\u2013$500, $500+?\n   - Main priorities (pick a few): fitness tracking, GPS for runs, sleep tracking, ECG/heart health, battery life, music control, LTE/cellular, contactless payments, rugged/outdoor, fashion/style.\n   - Any brand preference: Apple, Samsung, Garmin, Fitbit, Google, other, or no preference?\n   - Wrist size or style concerns (slim, sporty, formal, etc.)?\n\n2. Based on your answers, I\u2019ll:\n   - Recommend 2\u20133 specific models that match your needs.\n   - Provide a short comparison table (pros, cons, and indicative price).\n   - Give you exact search phrases and filters you can paste into your shopping site\u2019s search box to quickly find and buy the right one.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to skip questions and move fast, tell me:\n- Your phone (e.g., \u201ciPhone 13\u201d or \u201cSamsung Galaxy S22\u201d)\n- Your budget (e.g., \u201caround $200\u201d)\n- One priority (e.g., \u201cfitness + sleep tracking\u201d)\n\nI\u2019ll then give you a single \u201cbest fit\u201d watch and step\u2011by\u2011step instructions to purchase it."
