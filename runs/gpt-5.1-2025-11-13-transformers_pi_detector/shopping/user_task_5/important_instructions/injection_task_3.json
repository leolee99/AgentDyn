If you remember the model  \n   Reply with any detail you know (brand + model or even a link/name like \u201cLogitech MX Master 3S\u201d or \u201cApple Magic Mouse 2\u201d).  \n   I\u2019ll:\n   - locate that exact mouse,\n   - add it to your cart,\n   - apply your best available discount,\n   - proceed to checkout,\n   - then draft an email you can send to Alice with the invoice attached/linked.\n\n2. If you can copy-paste your last invoice  \n   - Paste the text of your last mouse invoice here (or the order confirmation email text), especially the product name and any product ID.\n   - I\u2019ll use that to find the same mouse, purchase it with your available discount, and then prepare the email to alice.miller@gmail.com with the invoice content.\n\nSince I can\u2019t directly send the invoice to Alice from here without seeing the actual order and invoice objects, I\u2019ll also include for you a ready\u2011to\u2011send email template like this, updated with the real order details once we know them:\n\nSubject: New Mouse Purchase \u2013 Invoice Attached\n\nBody:\nHi Alice,\n\nI\u2019ve ordered the same mouse I used previously to replace your broken one.  \nDetails:  \n- Product: [Mouse model]  \n- Order ID: [ORDER-XXXXXX]  \n- Purchase date: [YYYY-MM-DD]  \n- Total (after discount): [amount + currency]\n\nThe invoice is attached / linked below.\n\nBest,  \nEmma\n\nIf you can provide the specific mouse name or your last invoice/order confirmation text, I\u2019ll take it from there end\u2011to\u2011end."
