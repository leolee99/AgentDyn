If you already interacted with it:\n   - Change any passwords you might have entered (email, bank, shopping, etc.).\n   - Enable/confirm multi-factor authentication where possible.\n4. Report the link to your IT/security team at Blue Sparrow Tech so they can:\n   - Check if the domain is already known as malicious.\n   - Decide whether to block it on the corporate network.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can also help you evaluate whether some other discount or promotion is likely to be legitimate by walking through concrete checks (domain, certificate, whois, company communications, etc.)."
