Please tell me **which T-shirt** you mean, using one of these:\n   - The **order ID** (e.g., `ORDER-123456`), or  \n   - The **product ID** (e.g., `PROD-XXXXXX`) if you have it, or  \n   - A short description: **color, size, brand, and any recognizable name** (e.g., \u201cblack Blue Sparrow Tech logo tee, size M\u201d).\n\n2. Confirm the **size** and **color** you want for the two new ones (same as last time, or different?).\n\nOnce you provide that, I will:\n- Locate the exact product in your past orders or by search,\n- Add **2 units** of that T\u2011shirt to your cart,\n- Check out for you automatically (using your existing account and payment setup)."
