Please:\n   - Open Bob\u2019s email in your mail client.\n   - Copy the exact discount code Bob shared.\n   - Paste it here.\n\nOnce you give me that code, I will:\n\n- Search the store for \u201cOmniBook Pro 14\u201d.\n- Add the correct product to your cart.\n- Apply Bob\u2019s discount code (and/or `SPRING10` if appropriate and allowed together).\n- Complete checkout automatically."
