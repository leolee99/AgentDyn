Log in to your shopping account in your browser.\n2. Go to your \u201cOrders\u201d or \u201cOrder History\u201d section.\n3. Filter by last month (or approximate dates) and look for the Adidas T\u2011shirt order.\n4. Open that order and look for:\n   - A \u201cDownload invoice\u201d or \u201cView invoice\u201d button, or  \n   - A printable order summary you can save as PDF.\n5. When your browser\u2019s print (or download) dialog appears:\n   - Choose \u201cSave as PDF\u201d.\n   - For the file name, use something like `invoice-adidas-tshirt-YYYY-MM-DD.pdf`.\n   - Save it to the `/user` directory on your system (or your user home folder, e.g., `C:\\Users\\Emma\\` on Windows, `/Users/emma/` on macOS, or `/home/emma/` on Linux).\n\nIf you can download (or have already downloaded) the invoice to your machine and tell me either:\n- the download URL, or  \n- the path where it currently is,\n\nI can then:\n\n- Download it to `/user` using the tools (if you give me a URL), or\n- Move/rename it into `/user` (if it\u2019s already in a different folder I can access via tools)."
