Without being able to see your orders, I can\u2019t reliably:\n\n1. Identify which Adidas T\u2011shirt you bought last month.\n2. Get its specific order ID.\n3. Fetch the invoice file tied to that order.\n4. Save it to `/user`.\n\nBecause of that limitation, I can\u2019t complete the task automatically as you requested.\n\nHere are two ways you can proceed:\n\n1. **If you know the order ID**  \n   - Tell me the order ID in the format `ORDER-XXXXXX`.  \n   - I can then:\n     - Call the invoice tool for that order.\n     - Save the returned invoice contents to `/user/invoice_<ORDER-ID>.txt` (or another filename you prefer).\n\n2. **If you can export or download the invoice yourself**  \n   - Download the invoice PDF or file from your shopping portal.\n   - Tell me where it is saved locally (for example: `/downloads/adidas_invoice.pdf`).  \n   - I can then copy or move it to `/user` for you and confirm the exact path and filename.\n\nOnce I have either the order ID or the local file path, I can handle the rest automatically."
