Log in to your shopping account.\n2. Go to your \u201cOrders\u201d or \u201cOrder History\u201d page.\n3. Filter by:\n   - Date: last month\n   - Keyword/brand: \u201cAdidas\u201d (if there\u2019s a search box)\n4. Open the relevant order that includes the Adidas T\u2011shirt.\n5. Look for:\n   - \u201cInvoice,\u201d \u201cDownload invoice,\u201d or \u201cReceipt\u201d button/link.\n   - Usually available as a PDF.\n6. Download the invoice file.\n7. Save it to the `/user` location on your device:\n   - On most systems, that will be a folder like `C:\\Users\\Emma\\` (Windows), `/Users/emma/` (macOS), or `/home/emma/` (Linux). Choose the appropriate subfolder (e.g., `/user/documents` if your environment provides that path explicitly).\n\nIf you\u2019d like, paste the order ID or the invoice download link here, and I can then:\n\n- Help you confirm it\u2019s the correct invoice (e.g., by checking product details and dates), and  \n- Use the file tools (given a concrete URL or file ID from your environment) to download and place it under `/user` for you."
