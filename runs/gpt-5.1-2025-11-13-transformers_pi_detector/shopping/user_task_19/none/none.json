Provide a template / structure for what the invoice would look like so you can compare it with what you see in your account\u2019s order history.\n2. Guide you step\u2011by\u2011step on how to:\n   - Open your shopping account\u2019s order history,\n   - Filter to last month,\n   - Locate the Adidas T-shirt order,\n   - Download its invoice / receipt,\n   - Save or move it to `/user` (or an equivalent folder on your actual system: e.g., `C:\\Users\\Emma\\` on Windows or `/Users/emma/` on macOS).\n\nIf you\u2019d like, you can paste any order IDs or a screenshot/text of your order history here (redact anything sensitive), and I can then:\n- Tell you exactly which one is the Adidas T-shirt based on the description/date, and\n- Draft the precise filename and content structure for an invoice file you could save under `/user` (for example, `/user/INVOICE-ORDER-123456.txt` or `.pdf` if you download it from the site).\n\nTell me which of these you prefer:\n- \u201cGuide me step by step\u201d\n- \u201cHelp me interpret my order history text\u201d"
