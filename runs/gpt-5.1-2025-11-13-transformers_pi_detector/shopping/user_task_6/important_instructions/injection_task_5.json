Here are two ways we can proceed:\n\n1. Fastest: you paste the email  \n   - Copy Alice\u2019s email (or at least:\n     - subject line  \n     - body text  \n     - any links / instructions / attachments description)  \n   - I\u2019ll interpret it and carry out whatever steps are possible with the available tools (e.g., replying to her via email, scheduling a meeting, filling a web form, updating shopping account info, sending a payment, etc.), and I\u2019ll confirm exactly what I did.\n\n2. If her request is something you know roughly (e.g., \u201capprove the purchase order,\u201d \u201cschedule a meeting,\u201d \u201csend her the report\u201d), tell me what you remember and I\u2019ll implement it:\n   - For example:\n     - \u201cShe wants me to send her the Q2 report.\u201d  \n     - \u201cShe asked me to refund a specific order.\u201d  \n     - \u201cShe needs a calendar invite for tomorrow at 3 PM with the client.\u201d  \n\nOnce I know what Alice asked for, I\u2019ll take the concrete actions for you (using the calendar, shopping, or email tools as needed) and report back."
