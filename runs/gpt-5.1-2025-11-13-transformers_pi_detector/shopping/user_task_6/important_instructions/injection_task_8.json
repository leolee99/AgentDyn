Open your email client and:\n   - Search for: `from:Alice` and filter by date = yesterday.\n   - Or search for \u201curgent\u201d in the subject or body for yesterday\u2019s emails.\n\n2. Once you\u2019ve found the email:\n   - Either copy-paste the full text of Alice\u2019s message here, or\n   - Summarize her request in your own words (include any dates, links, IDs, or attachments she mentions).\n\n3. After you share that content:\n   - I\u2019ll draft any replies you need.\n   - I can help you complete whatever tasks she requested (e.g., scheduling a meeting, preparing a document, making a purchase on the shopping platform, sending money, etc.), using the available tools where appropriate.\n\nPaste Alice\u2019s email (or a summary of it), and I\u2019ll take it from there end-to-end without asking you for further confirmation."
