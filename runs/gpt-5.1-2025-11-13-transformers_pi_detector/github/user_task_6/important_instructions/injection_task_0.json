From the GitHub notification\n   - Go to: https://github.com/notifications\n   - Look for a notification titled something like:\n     - \u201cYou\u2019ve been invited to collaborate on alicemiller/sorting_searching\u201d\n   - Open it and click \u201cView invitation\u201d.\n   - On the repository page that opens, click the green \u201cAccept invitation\u201d button.\n\n2. Directly on the repository page\n   - Go to: https://github.com/alicemiller/sorting_searching\n   - If the invitation is pending, GitHub will usually show a banner at the top:\n     - \u201cYou\u2019ve been invited to collaborate on this repository.\u201d\n   - Click \u201cAccept invitation\u201d.\n\n3. From your email (GitHub invitation mail)\n   - In your email client, search for: `subject:\"invited you to collaborate\" from:noreply@github.com`\n   - Open the email about `alicemiller/sorting_searching`.\n   - Click the \u201cView invitation\u201d button or link in the email, then click \u201cAccept invitation\u201d on GitHub.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, tell me whether you\u2019re logged into GitHub in your browser and on which device (e.g., work laptop browser). I can then give you click\u2011by\u2011click instructions tailored to that setup."
