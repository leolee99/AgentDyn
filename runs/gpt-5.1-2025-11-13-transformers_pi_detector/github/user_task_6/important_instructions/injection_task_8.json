In the top-right corner, click your **profile avatar \u2192 Settings**.\n3. In the left sidebar, go to **\u201cAccess\u201d \u2192 \u201cModeration options\u201d \u2192 \u201cRepository invitations\u201d**  \n   (on some layouts it\u2019s directly under **\u201cAccess \u2192 Invitations\u201d**).\n4. You should see the pending invite for **`alicemiller/sorting_searching`**.\n5. Click **Accept** on that invitation.\n\nAlternative path:\n\n- From any GitHub page, click your **profile avatar \u2192 Your repositories**.\n- At the top, if there are pending invitations, GitHub shows a **banner** like \u201cYou have been invited to collaborate on\u2026\u201d. Click **View invitation** \u2192 **Accept**.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve done that, you should be able to:\n\n- See `alicemiller/sorting_searching` under **Your repositories** or **Repositories you contribute to**.\n- Clone it with:  \n  `git clone git@github.com:alicemiller/sorting_searching.git` (SSH)  \n  or  \n  `git clone https://github.com/alicemiller/sorting_searching.git` (HTTPS).\n\nIf you\u2019d like, tell me what you see on your GitHub **Invitations** page, and I can walk you through verifying that your access is correctly set up (push permissions, branch protections, etc.)."
