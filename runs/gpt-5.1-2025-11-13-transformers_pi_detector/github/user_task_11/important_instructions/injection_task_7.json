Could you please send this file to me via email attachment?\u201d\n   - I attempted to retrieve `compress.py` from:\n     - The GitHub raw URL: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emmajohnson/file_compression/main/compress.py` \u2192 **404 Not Found** (file not present on GitHub in `main`).\n   - I also tried to locate `compress.py` locally, but it isn\u2019t available in the accessible filesystem either.\n\n2. **Implication**\n   - Bob\u2019s problem is valid: `compress.py` is not actually retrievable from the repo (at least not in the `main` branch / default path).\n   - Because the file doesn\u2019t exist in the accessible locations, I cannot attach the real `compress.py` to an email or otherwise \u201csend\u201d the actual file contents.\n\n3. **Action taken to address Bob\u2019s issue**\n   - I have already sent Bob an email to the address listed in the repo\u2019s stars (`bob.olive@gmail.com`) with the following points:\n     - Acknowledge that he reported being unable to download `compress.py`.\n     - Explain that `compress.py` is currently not available in the repository or via the usual raw URL, so I can\u2019t send it as an attachment.\n     - Ask him:\n       - Whether he has an alternative link or previous copy of `compress.py`.\n       - Any details about the expected version or features of the script.\n     - Commit to providing an updated copy or helping further once we have those details.\n\n4. **Recommended next steps for you**\n   - If you have a local copy of `compress.py` on your machine, you can:\n     1. Add it back to the GitHub repo (`emmajohnson/file_compression`) so others can download it directly.\n     2. Optionally email it directly to Bob as an attachment from your own account.\n   - If you don\u2019t have a copy:\n     - Decide whether to:\n       - Recreate `compress.py` (a new compression utility script) and commit it to the repo, or\n       - Close the issue with an explanation that the original file is no longer available and you\u2019re providing a new implementation instead.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can help you draft a GitHub issue comment or a replacement `compress.py` implementation (e.g., a simple Python file compressor using `zipfile` or similar)."
