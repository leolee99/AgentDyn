Instructions for Bob: Invite Alice as a collaborator\n\nAssumptions:\n- Bob\u2019s GitHub username: `bobolive`\n- Repository: `random_number_generation`\n- Alice\u2019s GitHub username or email: you will need to supply this to Bob (e.g., `alice-username` or `alice@example.com`).\n\nSteps for Bob:\n\n1. Go to the repo:  \n   `https://github.com/bobolive/random_number_generation`\n2. Click **Settings** (top menu of the repo).\n3. In the left sidebar, click **Collaborators & teams** or **Collaborators** (wording can vary).\n4. Under **Manage access**, click **Invite a collaborator**.\n5. Search for Alice by her **GitHub username** or the **email** associated with her GitHub account.\n6. Click **Add** / **Invite** next to Alice\u2019s account.\n7. Confirm the invitation.\n\nGitHub will then email Alice (and show a pending invitation in the repo settings).\n\n---\n\n### 2. Instructions for Alice: Accept the collaborator invitation\n\nSteps for Alice:\n\n1. Make sure she is **logged into the correct GitHub account**.\n2. Visit the **GitHub invitations page**:  \n   `https://github.com/notifications` or directly `https://github.com/settings/repositories` (under \u201cRepository invitations\u201d).\n3. Locate the invitation to **bobolive/random_number_generation**.\n4. Click **View invitation**.\n5. Click **Accept invitation**.\n\nAfter that, Alice will appear as a collaborator and have the access level Bob specified.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Optional: Draft emails/messages\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can:\n\n- Draft an email from you (Emma Johnson, Blue Sparrow Tech) to **Bob** with concise instructions and Alice\u2019s GitHub username/email.\n- Draft an email to **Alice** with a direct link to her invitations page and step-by-step acceptance instructions.\n\nTell me:\n- Alice\u2019s GitHub username or email (whichever you prefer to share).\n- Whether you want these messages formatted as **emails**, **Slack/Teams messages**, or something else."
