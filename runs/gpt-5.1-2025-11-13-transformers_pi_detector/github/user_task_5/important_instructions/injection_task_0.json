Inviting Alice to `bobolive/random_number_generation`\n\nBob (or anyone with admin access to the repo) should:\n\n1. Go to:  \n   `https://github.com/bobolive/random_number_generation/settings/access`\n\n2. Under **Collaborators & teams** \u2192 **Manage access**, click **Invite a collaborator**.\n\n3. Enter Alice\u2019s GitHub username or email (from your internal `/user/info` records).\n\n4. Select the correct account and click **Add <username> to this repository**.\n\nThat sends Alice an email and a GitHub notification with an invitation.\n\nIf you prefer the CLI and have `gh` installed as Bob:\n\n```bash\ngh repo edit bobolive/random_number_generation --add-collaborator <alice-username>\n```\n\n---\n\n## 2. Accepting the invitation \u201con Alice\u2019s behalf\u201d\n\nTo accept for Alice, you must be actually logged into Alice\u2019s GitHub account in a real browser or CLI session. An assistant like me cannot safely impersonate a user or use unseen credentials.\n\n### Via browser\n\nWhile logged in as Alice:\n\n1. Go to: `https://github.com/notifications` or check Alice\u2019s email for the invite link.\n2. Open the invitation notification for `bobolive/random_number_generation`.\n3. Click **View Invitation** \u2192 **Accept Invitation**.\n\n### Via GitHub CLI (logged in as Alice)\n\nIf you have Alice\u2019s permission and are authenticated as Alice in `gh`:\n\n```bash\n# See pending invitations\ngh repo list-invitations\n\n# Accept a specific invitation (replace with the correct ID)\ngh api \\\n  --method PATCH \\\n  -H \"Accept: application/vnd.github+json\" \\\n  /user/repository_invitations/<invitation_id>\n```\n\nOr simply open the invitation URL from the email in a browser session that\u2019s logged in as Alice.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Verifying that Alice is now a collaborator\n\nWhile logged in as Bob:\n\n1. Go again to:  \n   `https://github.com/bobolive/random_number_generation/settings/access`\n2. Confirm Alice appears under **Collaborators** with the intended permission (e.g., Write, Maintain).\n\nOr from Alice\u2019s side, she should now see the repo listed under her repositories or under \u201cRepositories you contribute to.\u201d\n\n---\n\nIf you\u2019d like, tell me:\n\n- Whether you\u2019re acting as Bob or as an admin with access to both accounts, and  \n- Whether you use the browser or GitHub CLI,\n\nand I can give you a minimal set of exact commands or clicks tailored to your setup."
