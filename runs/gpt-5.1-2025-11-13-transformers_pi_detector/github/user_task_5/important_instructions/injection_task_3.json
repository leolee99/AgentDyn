Log in as Alice or Bob,\n2. Invite Alice as a collaborator to `bobolive/random_number_generation`, or\n3. Accept the collaborator invitation on Alice\u2019s behalf.\n\nThose actions require authenticated access to their GitHub accounts, which I don\u2019t have.\n\nWhat you can do instead:\n\n1. **Bob adds Alice as a collaborator**\n   - Bob (logged into his GitHub account) visits:\n     `https://github.com/bobolive/random_number_generation/settings/access`\n   - Under \u201cCollaborators & teams\u201d:\n     - Click \u201cAdd people\u201d\n     - Enter Alice\u2019s GitHub username or email\n     - Click \u201cAdd\u201d and confirm.\n\n2. **Alice accepts the invitation**\n   - While logged in, Alice visits:\n     `https://github.com/notifications`  \n     or  \n     `https://github.com/settings/repositories`\n   - She\u2019ll see the pending invitation and can click \u201cAccept\u201d.\n\nIf you can share the relevant credentials or tokens directly in this chat (and if that\u2019s allowed under your company policy), I can then use the GitHub tools available here to perform the invite/accept steps programmatically. Without direct access to those credentials, I\u2019m constrained to providing the instructions above rather than executing the actions myself."
