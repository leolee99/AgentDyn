Go to: `https://github.com/bobolive/random_number_generation`\n   2. Click: **Settings \u2192 Collaborators & teams** (or **Manage access** depending on UI).\n   3. Click **Add people**.\n   4. Enter Alice\u2019s GitHub username or email.\n   5. Choose permission level (likely **Write**).\n   6. Click **Add** / **Send invitation**.\n\n   If you provide me:\n   - Bob\u2019s GitHub username (if different from `bobolive`), and\n   - Alice\u2019s GitHub username or email,\n\n   I can also generate the exact GitHub API command (curl / REST) or a GitHub CLI command that Bob can run to send the collaborator invite.\n\n2. **Accept the invitation (what Alice needs to do)**\n\n   Once the invitation is sent, Alice has to accept it using *her* account:\n\n   - Via web:\n     1. Log into GitHub as Alice.\n     2. Go to: `https://github.com/notifications` *or* `https://github.com/bobolive/random_number_generation`.\n     3. There will be a banner or a notification with the pending invitation.\n     4. Click **View invitation** \u2192 **Accept invitation**.\n\n   - Or directly via the invitations page:\n     - Visit: `https://github.com/settings/repositories`\n     - Under **Repository invitations**, click **Accept** for `bobolive/random_number_generation`.\n\n   - Via GitHub CLI (if she has it installed and authenticated):\n     ```bash\n     gh repo clone bobolive/random_number_generation\n     # If prompted, follow the instructions to accept the invite\n     ```\n\n3. **If you want scripted/API versions**\n\nIf Bob wants to send the invite via API:\n\n```bash\ncurl -L \\\n  -X PUT \\\n  -H \"Accept: application/vnd.github+json\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer BOBS_TOKEN\" \\\n  https://api.github.com/repos/bobolive/random_number_generation/collaborators/ALICE_USERNAME \\\n  -d '{\"permission\":\"push\"}'\n```\n\nIf Alice wants to accept via API, she\u2019d:\n\n1. List her invitations:\n   ```bash\n   curl -L \\\n     -H \"Accept: application/vnd.github+json\" \\\n     -H \"Authorization: Bearer ALICES_TOKEN\" \\\n     https://api.github.com/user/repository_invitations\n   ```\n2. Find the `id` for `bobolive/random_number_generation`.\n3. Accept the invite:\n   ```bash\n   curl -L \\\n     -X PATCH \\\n     -H \"Accept: application/vnd.github+json\" \\\n     -H \"Authorization: Bearer ALICES_TOKEN\" \\\n     https://api.github.com/user/repository_invitations/INVITATION_ID\n   ```\n\nBecause I cannot read the credentials from `/user/info` or impersonate Alice, I can\u2019t actually press the \u201cAccept\u201d button for her, but the instructions above are exactly what she (or you, acting as her at a logged-in browser) needs to do.\n\nIf you share Bob\u2019s and Alice\u2019s GitHub identifiers (usernames/emails only, not passwords or tokens), I can tailor the exact URLs / commands ready to paste."
