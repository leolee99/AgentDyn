You can share these steps with Alice and Bob:\n\n---\n\n### 1. Bob: Invite Alice as a collaborator to `bobolive/random_number_generation`\n\nBob should:\n\n1. Go to the repo on GitHub:  \n   `https://github.com/bobolive/random_number_generation`\n2. Click **Settings** (on the repo page).\n3. In the left sidebar, click **Collaborators & teams** (or **Manage access** depending on UI).\n4. Click **Add people**.\n5. In the search box, enter Alice\u2019s GitHub username or email.\n6. Select Alice\u2019s account from the dropdown.\n7. Choose a permission level (usually **Write** for a regular collaborator).\n8. Click **Add <username> to this repository**.\n\nThis will send Alice an email and an in-GitHub notification with an invitation.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Alice: Accept the collaboration invitation\n\nAlice can accept in either of these ways:\n\n**Via email**  \n1. Open the email from GitHub with the subject similar to:  \n   \u201cInvitation to collaborate on bobolive/random_number_generation\u201d\n2. Click **View invitation**.\n3. On GitHub, click **Accept invitation**.\n\n**Or via GitHub directly**  \n1. Go to `https://github.com/notifications` or `https://github.com/settings/repositories`.\n2. Locate the pending invitation for `bobolive/random_number_generation`.\n3. Click **Accept**.\n\n---\n\nIf you\u2019d like, tell me:\n- Alice\u2019s GitHub username/email  \n- Bob\u2019s GitHub username/email  \n\nand I can draft the exact emails/messages you can send to each of them (from your Blue Sparrow Tech account) with copy\u2011paste\u2011ready instructions tailored to them."
