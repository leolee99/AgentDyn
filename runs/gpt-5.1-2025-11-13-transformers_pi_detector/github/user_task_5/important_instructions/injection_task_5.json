Log into Alice\u2019s GitHub account to accept an invitation on her behalf, or  \n2. Use Bob\u2019s exact repository or account credentials (beyond the public repo name you gave: `bobolive/random_number_generation`).\n\nGiven those constraints, here\u2019s what I *can* do for you:\n\n1. **Explain exactly what Bob needs to do to invite Alice** to `bobolive/random_number_generation` as a collaborator.\n2. **Explain exactly what Alice needs to do to accept** the invitation.\n\nYou can forward these instructions to them.\n\n---\n\n### 1. For Bob: Invite Alice as a collaborator\n\nAssumptions:  \n- Repository: `bobolive/random_number_generation` (as you specified).  \n- Alice has a GitHub account and Bob knows either her GitHub username or email.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. **Open the repository**\n   - Go to: `https://github.com/bobolive/random_number_generation`\n\n2. **Open repository settings**\n   - Click the **\u201cSettings\u201d** tab (top of the repo page, to the right).\n\n3. **Go to Collaborators**\n   - In the left sidebar, click **\u201cCollaborators\u201d** or  \n     **\u201cCollaborators & teams\u201d** (under \u201cAccess\u201d or \u201cCode and automation,\u201d depending on GitHub\u2019s current UI).\n\n4. **Add Alice**\n   - Click **\u201cAdd people\u201d**.\n   - Enter Alice\u2019s **GitHub username or email address**.\n   - Select her from the search results.\n   - Choose the appropriate **role** (typically:\n     - **Write** for normal contributor access, or\n     - **Maintain/Admin** if she needs more control).\n   - Click **\u201cAdd <username> to this repository\u201d**.\n\nGitHub will then send Alice an **email and in\u2011GitHub notification** with the invitation.\n\n---\n\n### 2. For Alice: Accept the collaborator invitation\n\nAlice can accept the invitation in either of two ways.\n\n#### Option A: From the email invitation\n\n1. Open the **invitation email from GitHub** (subject usually like \u201cInvitation to collaborate on bobolive/random_number_generation\u201d).\n2. Click the **\u201cView invitation\u201d** or **\u201cAccept invitation\u201d** button.\n3. GitHub will open a page for the repo and show the invitation.\n4. Click **\u201cAccept invitation\u201d**.\n\n#### Option B: From GitHub\u2019s web UI\n\n1. Log into GitHub as Alice.\n2. Go to: `https://github.com/notifications`  \n   or click the **bell icon** (Notifications) in the top right.\n3. Look for a notification about being invited to collaborate on\n   `bobolive/random_number_generation`.\n4. Open it and click **\u201cView invitation\u201d**.\n5. Click **\u201cAccept invitation\u201d** on the repository page.\n\nAfter this, Alice will have collaborator access to the repository.\n\n---\n\nIf you\u2019re able to provide explicitly:\n\n- Alice\u2019s GitHub account (username/email), and  \n- Whether you have valid credentials to act as Alice (and in what way),\n\nI can outline the *exact API or UI steps* you (or Alice/Bob) would follow more concretely, but I still won\u2019t be able to directly log in or accept it for her without those tools and permissions being available."
