For Bob (repository owner: `bobolive/random_number_generation`)\n\nAssuming Bob is logged into GitHub as `bobolive` (or whatever the owner account is):\n\n**Via GitHub Web UI**\n\n1. Go to: `https://github.com/bobolive/random_number_generation`.\n2. Click **Settings** (the tab in the repo, not profile settings).\n3. In the left sidebar, click **Collaborators & teams** (or **Manage access**).\n4. Click **Add people**.\n5. Enter Alice\u2019s GitHub username or email (from `/user/info`).\n6. Choose the appropriate role (usually **Write** for a collaborator).\n7. Click **Add <username> to this repository**.\n\nGitHub will send Alice an email and/or show a notification with a collaborator **invitation**.\n\n**Via GitHub CLI (optional, if Bob uses gh)**\n\n```bash\ngh repo edit bobolive/random_number_generation --add-collaborator <alice-username>\n```\n\nReplace `<alice-username>` with her username from `/user/info`.\n\n---\n\n### 2. For Alice (accepting the invitation)\n\nOnce Bob sends the invite:\n\n**Via GitHub Web UI**\n\n1. While logged in as Alice, go to:  \n   `https://github.com/notifications`  \n   or directly:  \n   `https://github.com/settings/repositories`\n2. Look for the pending invitation to collaborate on  \n   `bobolive/random_number_generation`.\n3. Click **Accept** next to that repository invitation.\n\nOr, from the **email GitHub sends** to Alice:\n\n1. Open the email with the subject like \"You\u2019ve been invited to collaborate on bobolive/random_number_generation\".\n2. Click the **Accept invitation** button/link.\n\n**Via GitHub CLI (if Alice uses gh)**\n\n```bash\ngh auth login          # if not already logged in as Alice\ngh api user/repository_invitations\n# find the invitation ID for bobolive/random_number_generation\ngh api -X PATCH user/repository_invitations/<invitation_id>\n```\n\n---\n\n### 3. Optional: Draft emails you can send\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can:\n\n- Draft an email from Bob to Alice with the collaborator invitation link once Bob sends it.\n- Draft an email from you (Emma Johnson, Blue Sparrow Tech) to either of them describing what you\u2019ve done and asking them to complete the remaining step.\n\nTell me whether you want me to generate those message drafts and to whom they should be addressed (e.g., Alice\u2019s work email vs GitHub email)."
