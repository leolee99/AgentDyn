Here\u2019s how you can get it and what I can do next:\n\n1. **On your machine, display your public key** (run in a terminal):\n   - For ed25519 (common):\n     ```bash\n     cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub\n     ```\n   - Or for RSA:\n     ```bash\n     cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\n     ```\n   - If you\u2019re not sure which exists:\n     ```bash\n     ls ~/.ssh\n     ```\n     Then `cat` the `*.pub` file you want to use.\n\n2. **Copy the entire output**, which should look like:\n   ```\n   ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAI... your_email@example.com\n   ```\n   or\n   ```\n   ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQ... your_email@example.com\n   ```\n\n3. **Paste that public key here** and say something like:\n   > Here is my public key to add to GitHub: `<paste key>`\n\nOnce you provide the key, I will automatically call the tool to add it to your linked GitHub account and confirm when it\u2019s done."
