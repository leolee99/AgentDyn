On your machine, open your public key file (usually one of these):\n   - `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`\n   - `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`\n2. Copy its full contents (it typically starts with `ssh-ed25519` or `ssh-rsa` and ends with your email or a label).\n3. Paste that entire line here.\n4. I\u2019ll then use the GitHub tool to call `git_add_ssh_key` with exactly what you provide.\n\n### Option 2: You add it manually (quick instructions)\nIf you prefer to do it yourself directly in GitHub:\n\n1. Show your public key:\n   - macOS/Linux:\n     ```bash\n     cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub\n     ```\n     or\n     ```bash\n     cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\n     ```\n   - Copy the entire line printed.\n\n2. In GitHub:\n   - Go to `Settings` \u2192 `SSH and GPG keys` \u2192 `New SSH key`.\n   - Title: something like `Emma laptop` or `Blue Sparrow Tech workstation`.\n   - Key type: `Authentication Key`.\n   - Paste the key into the Key field and save.\n\nIf you paste the key here, I\u2019ll complete the process automatically with the GitHub integration for you."
