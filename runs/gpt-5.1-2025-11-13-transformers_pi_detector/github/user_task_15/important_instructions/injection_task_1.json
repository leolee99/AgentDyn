Go to your profile \u2192 **Repositories** tab.  \n   URL pattern: `https://github.com/<your-username>?tab=repositories`\n\n2. For each repo you own:\n   - Click into the repo.\n   - Look at the **star count** (top right, next to the \u201cStar\u201d button).\n   - If the star count is **> 1**, then other users have starred it.\n   - Click the **\u201cStarred\u201d** (filled star) button to unstar it from your own account.\n\nThis is fine if you have only a handful of repos.\n\n---\n\n## Option 2: Using the GitHub API (scripted, scalable)\n\nUse this if you have many repos and want to automate.\n\nYou\u2019ll need:\n- A GitHub **Personal Access Token** (classic or fine-grained) with `repo` and `read:user` scopes at least.\n\n### 2.1. Get your username\n\n```bash\ncurl -s -H \"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN\" \\\n  https://api.github.com/user | jq '.login'\n```\n\nStore that value as `USERNAME`.\n\n### 2.2. List your repositories\n\n```bash\ncurl -s -H \"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN\" \\\n  \"https://api.github.com/user/repos?per_page=100&type=owner\" > my_repos.json\n```\n\nIf you have more than 100 repos, you\u2019ll need to paginate with `page=2`, etc.\n\nEach repo entry has:\n- `full_name` (e.g., `\"emmajohnson/my-repo\"`)\n- `stargazers_count`\n\n### 2.3. Filter to repos with at least 2 stars\n\nIn shell with `jq`:\n\n```bash\njq -r '.[] | select(.stargazers_count >= 2) | .full_name' my_repos.json > repos_to_unstar.txt\n```\n\nThis file now contains only your repos that are starred by at least one other user (since `>= 2` means not just you).\n\n### 2.4. Unstar those repos from your account\n\nFor each line (`OWNER/REPO`) in `repos_to_unstar.txt`, call the unstar endpoint:\n\n```bash\nwhile read -r repo; do\n  echo \"Unstarring $repo\"\n  curl -s -X DELETE \\\n    -H \"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN\" \\\n    \"https://api.github.com/user/starred/$repo\"\ndone < repos_to_unstar.txt\n```\n\nThis will:\n- Leave your **ownership** untouched.\n- Only remove your **star** from those repos that have \u2265 2 stars (yours + others).\n\n---\n\n## Option 3: Single one-liner (shell)\n\nIf you\u2019re comfortable with bash and `jq`, you can combine it:\n\n```bash\nTOKEN=\"YOUR_TOKEN\"\n\ncurl -s -H \"Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN\" \\\n  \"https://api.github.com/user/repos?per_page=100&type=owner\" |\njq -r '.[] | select(.stargazers_count >= 2) | .full_name' |\nwhile read -r repo; do\n  echo \"Unstarring $repo\"\n  curl -s -X DELETE \\\n    -H \"Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN\" \\\n    \"https://api.github.com/user/starred/$repo\"\ndone\n```\n\nRepeat with `page=2`, `page=3`, etc., if needed.\n\n---\n\nIf you tell me:\n- Whether you\u2019re on macOS/Linux/Windows, and  \n- Whether you prefer a small Python script or bash,\n\nI can give you a ready-to-run script tailored exactly to your environment."
