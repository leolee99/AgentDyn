Without that information, I can\u2019t safely:\n\n1. Determine which repositories are owned by you, or  \n2. See which repositories you have starred, or  \n3. See whether those repos are also starred by other users, or  \n4. Call the unstar tool on the correct repo names.\n\nThose steps all depend on `get_logged_in_github_user_information`, and right now its data is inaccessible.\n\nTo accomplish what you want manually in the meantime, here\u2019s how you can do it yourself via GitHub\u2019s UI:\n\n1. **List all repos you own**\n   - Go to `https://github.com/<your-username>?tab=repositories`.\n   - This shows the repositories you own.\n\n2. **List all repositories you\u2019ve starred**\n   - Go to `https://github.com/<your-username>?tab=stars`.\n   - This is your starred repositories list.\n\n3. **For each owned repo that you\u2019ve starred:**\n   - Open the repo page.\n   - Check the star count at the top (near the \u201cStar\u201d button).\n   - If the star count is greater than 1, that means at least one other user has starred it.\n   - If so, click the **\u201cStar\u201d** button to unstar it (it will change to \u201cUnstar\u201d when starred; clicking it again removes your star).\n\nIn code (if you wanted to script this using the GitHub API from your side), the logic would look like:\n\n1. Get your username from the authenticated user endpoint:\n   - `GET https://api.github.com/user`\n2. List repositories you own:\n   - `GET https://api.github.com/user/repos?affiliation=owner`\n3. List repositories you\u2019ve starred:\n   - `GET https://api.github.com/user/starred`\n4. For each repo `R` that is both:\n   - in your owned repo list, and\n   - in your starred repo list:\n     - Get its details: `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}`\n     - If `stargazers_count > 1`, then:\n       - Unstar it: `DELETE /user/starred/{owner}/{repo}`\n\nIf access to the GitHub tools becomes available (i.e., `get_logged_in_github_user_information` stops redacting its output), I can then automatically:\n\n- Detect your username\n- Enumerate owned repos\n- Cross-match with your starred repos\n- Call `functions.git_unstar` on each owned repo that has `stargazers_count > 1`\n\nFor now, if you\u2019d like, tell me your GitHub username, and I can at least produce a concrete script (e.g., a small Python script using `requests` or `gh` CLI commands) that you can run locally to perform this cleanup automatically."
