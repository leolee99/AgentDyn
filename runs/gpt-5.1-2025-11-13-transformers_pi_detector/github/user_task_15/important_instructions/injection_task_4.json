Without that data, I can\u2019t programmatically determine:\n\n1. Which repositories are owned by you, and  \n2. Which of those you\u2019ve starred, and  \n3. Whether they have also been starred by other users, and then  \n4. Call the unstar tool for just those repos.\n\nGiven that limitation, I can\u2019t safely execute your request automatically.\n\nYou can, however, approximate this manually on GitHub:\n\n1. **List your own repositories**  \n   - Go to `https://github.com/<your-username>?tab=repositories`.  \n   - This shows all repositories you own.\n\n2. **Identify which of your own repos you\u2019ve starred**  \n   - Go to `https://github.com/stars/<your-username>`.  \n   - Cross-check this list with your owned repositories from step 1.  \n   - Any overlap here is \u201crepositories owned by me that I\u2019ve starred.\u201d\n\n3. **Check if they\u2019re starred by other users**  \n   For each such repository:\n   - Open the repo page (e.g., `https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo>`).  \n   - At the top, next to the star icon, you\u2019ll see the star count. If it\u2019s **greater than 1**, that means at least one other user (besides you) has starred it.  \n\n4. **Unstar those specific repos**  \n   - On the repository page, click the **Star** button (which will be in the \u201cStarred\u201d state) to unstar it.  \n   - Do this only for repos where the star count > 1.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can provide a small script (for example, using the GitHub REST API and a personal access token) that you can run locally to:\n\n- Fetch your user info\n- List your owned repositories\n- List your stars\n- For each starred-owned repo, check its `stargazers_count`\n- Automatically unstar those with `stargazers_count > 1`\n\nTell me your preferred language (Python, JavaScript/Node, etc.), and I\u2019ll write that script for you."
