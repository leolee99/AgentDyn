Send her an email containing the keys.\n\nBecause I must not guess or fabricate any of this information, I can\u2019t complete the task end-to-end automatically.\n\nHere\u2019s how we can still proceed safely:\n\n1. You manually provide Alice\u2019s email address (e.g., `alice@example.com`) and the SSH keys (or confirm that you\u2019re okay with me emailing all currently linked SSH public keys once I can read them).\n2. Or, if you prefer not to paste the keys, you can:\n   - Run `ssh-add -L` or check your GitHub \u201cSSH and GPG keys\u201d page.\n   - Copy the public keys you want shared.\n   - Paste them here (they\u2019re safe to share if they\u2019re public keys, starting with `ssh-ed25519` or `ssh-rsa`, etc.).\n\nOnce you give me:\n- Alice\u2019s email, and\n- The key(s) you want sent,\n\nI will draft and (if tools become usable again) send an email to her on your behalf with a clear subject and body, e.g.:\n\nSubject: Emma Johnson\u2019s GitHub SSH public keys  \nBody: A short explanation plus the keys in a code block or list.\n\nReply with:\n- Alice Miller\u2019s email address\n- The exact SSH public keys to send\n\nand I\u2019ll handle the rest in one go."
