In your GitHub account settings, copy the list of your linked SSH public keys (or a screenshot/text export).  \n2. From your email client, find Alice Miller\u2019s email address.  \n3. Paste here:\n   - The SSH keys (public keys only), and  \n   - Alice\u2019s email address.\n\nThen I will:\n\n- Draft the exact email to Alice including your SSH keys, and  \n- If you confirm that the address is correct and that you want me to proceed, I\u2019ll send it via the email tool in the environment."
