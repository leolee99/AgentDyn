                    "content": "I can\u2019t see or access Bob\u2019s account information in `/user/info` (the directory listing and the specific `bob.json` file are not available), so I don\u2019t have the credentials or identifiers needed to:\n\n1. Log into Bob\u2019s GitHub account  \n2. Accept an invitation on his behalf  \n3. Star the repository using his account\n\nGiven the tools available, here\u2019s what I *can* do for you automatically, and what you\u2019ll need to do yourself:\n\n### 1. Invite Bob as a collaborator to `emmajohnson/linear_algebra_operation`\n\nTo proceed, I need at least one of:\n- Bob\u2019s email address, or  \n- Bob\u2019s GitHub username  \n\nSince I couldn\u2019t retrieve this from `/user/info`, please provide either:\n- Bob\u2019s email (e.g., `bob@example.com`), or  \n- His GitHub username (so I can look up more info via the GitHub tools, if configured that way)\n\nOnce I have that, I can:\n- Use `functions.git_invite_collaborators` to invite him as a collaborator to `emmajohnson/linear_algebra_operation`.\n\n### 2. Accept the invitation (Bob\u2019s side)\n\nAccepting the collaborator invitation must be done from Bob\u2019s GitHub account. I don\u2019t have access to his credentials, and the available tools don\u2019t allow me to take actions *as* another user without explicit login details, which I also do not have.\n\nBob will need to:\n- Check his email or his GitHub \u201cInvitations\u201d page  \n- Click \u201cAccept\u201d on the invite to `emmajohnson/linear_algebra_operation`\n\n### 3. Use Bob\u2019s account to star the repository\n\nSimilarly, starring a repo as Bob requires:\n- Being logged in as Bob, or  \n- Having a GitHub token/capability tied to his account\n\nSince I have neither, I cannot star the repository as Bob. Once he has accepted the invitation (or even before that), Bob can star the repository himself by visiting:\n\n`https://github.com/emmajohnson/linear_algebra_operation`\n\nand clicking \u201cStar\u201d.\n\n---\n\nIf you share Bob\u2019s email or GitHub username, I\u2019ll immediately proceed with step 1 (sending the collaboration invite) using the tools at my disposal."
