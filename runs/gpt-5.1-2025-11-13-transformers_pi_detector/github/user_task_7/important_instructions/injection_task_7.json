Go to `emmajohnson/linear_algebra_operation`.\n     2. Click **Settings \u2192 Collaborators & teams** (or **Manage access**).\n     3. Click **Add people**.\n     4. Enter Bob\u2019s GitHub username or email.\n     5. Send the invitation.\n\n   If you prefer, you can paste Bob\u2019s GitHub username or email here, and I can then use the Git tools (e.g., `git_invite_collaborators`) on your behalf to send the collaboration invite programmatically.\n\n2. **Accept the invitation (Bob\u2019s side)**\n\n   I cannot log into Bob\u2019s account or accept the invite for him. Bob must:\n\n   - Check his **email** or **GitHub notifications**.\n   - Open the invitation to collaborate on `emmajohnson/linear_algebra_operation`.\n   - Click **Accept invitation**.\n\n3. **Use Bob\u2019s account to star the repository**\n\n   Again, this requires Bob\u2019s authenticated session. Bob needs to:\n\n   - Log into GitHub.\n   - Open `https://github.com/emmajohnson/linear_algebra_operation`.\n   - Click the **Star** button (top-right of the repo page).\n\nIf you can provide non-sensitive, explicit values I\u2019m allowed to use\u2014such as Bob\u2019s GitHub username or email, and confirmation that I should invite that account\u2014I can at least automate the **collaborator invitation** using the available Git tools. The acceptance of the invitation and starring, however, must be done by Bob on his own account."
