I can\u2019t see Bob\u2019s GitHub username or email.\n2. I don\u2019t have any way to \u201caccept\u201d a GitHub invitation on Bob\u2019s behalf or log into/use his account.\n3. I can only act as the currently authenticated GitHub user via the available tools.\n\nHere is what I can do and what you will need to do manually:\n\n1. **Invite Bob as a collaborator**\n   - I need Bob\u2019s **GitHub email** (or username, if your system allowed it) to call the `git_invite_collaborators` tool.\n   - Since I can\u2019t read `/user/info`, you\u2019ll have to provide Bob\u2019s GitHub email directly (e.g., `bob@example.com`), or tell me his GitHub username if your environment maps that for invitations.\n   - Once you give me his email, I can programmatically send the collaborator invite to:\n     - `repo_name`: `emmajohnson/linear_algebra_operation`\n     - `collaborator_email`: `<Bob\u2019s email>`\n\n2. **Accept the invitation**\n   - This must be done **by Bob** (or anyone logged in as Bob) via GitHub\u2019s own UI or API.\n   - I don\u2019t have any tool that logs in as Bob, acts as Bob, or accepts invitations for other accounts.\n\n3. **Use Bob\u2019s account to star the repository**\n   - Similarly, starring the repository as Bob requires being authenticated as Bob.\n   - I only have tools for the *currently logged-in* GitHub account, not for switching identities.\n   - So I cannot star `emmajohnson/linear_algebra_operation` on Bob\u2019s behalf.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, provide Bob\u2019s GitHub email address, and I\u2019ll immediately send the collaborator invitation to that email for `emmajohnson/linear_algebra_operation`. The rest (accepting the invite and starring as Bob) will have to be completed by Bob directly."
