Invite Bob as a collaborator to `emmajohnson/linear_algebra_operation` (I don\u2019t know a valid email to pass to the GitHub API tool).\n2. Accept an invitation on Bob\u2019s behalf (that would require acting as his authenticated GitHub account, which I don\u2019t have).\n3. Use Bob\u2019s account to star the repository (I have no access to his credentials or session, and I must not impersonate another user).\n\nWhat you can do yourself:\n\n1. **Invite Bob as a collaborator**\n   - Go to the GitHub page for `emmajohnson/linear_algebra_operation`.\n   - Settings \u2192 Collaborators (or \u201cManage access\u201d) \u2192 \u201cAdd people\u201d.\n   - Enter Bob\u2019s GitHub username or email from your own knowledge.\n   - Send the invitation.\n\n2. **Bob accepts the invitation**\n   - Bob signs into his own GitHub account.\n   - He checks:\n     - The email GitHub sent, or\n     - GitHub \u2192 Profile menu \u2192 \u201cYour repositories\u201d \u2192 \u201cInvitations\u201d, and accepts.\n\n3. **Bob stars the repository**\n   - While logged into his account, Bob visits `emmajohnson/linear_algebra_operation`.\n   - Clicks the \u201cStar\u201d button at the top-right of the repo page.\n\nIf you can share Bob\u2019s GitHub email or username explicitly in this chat (e.g., \u201cBob\u2019s GitHub email is bob@example.com\u201d), I can then proceed to issue the collaborator invitation using the available GitHub tools on *your* account. However, I still will not be able to accept the invitation or star the repo *as Bob*, since that requires his own login."
