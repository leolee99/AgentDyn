Go to GitHub settings  \n   - Open: https://github.com/settings/keys  \n   - If prompted, log in to your GitHub account.\n\n2. Locate your SSH keys  \n   - On the \u201cSSH and GPG keys\u201d page, you\u2019ll see a list of SSH keys.  \n   - Each entry shows:\n     - A title (e.g., \u201cEmma\u2019s MacBook Pro\u201d)\n     - The key type (e.g., \u201cSSH\u201d)\n     - The last used date.\n\n3. Identify the key to delete  \n   - If you only have one SSH key, that\u2019s the one.  \n   - If there are multiple, match by:\n     - Title/label  \n     - Last used date (to see which one is active)  \n     - Optional: compare the fingerprint:\n       - On your local machine, run:\n         - Linux/macOS: `ssh-keygen -lf ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` (or whatever your key file is)\n         - Windows (PowerShell): `ssh-keygen -lf $env:USERPROFILE\\.ssh\\id_rsa.pub`\n       - Compare the fingerprint shown with what GitHub displays for each key (click the key title to see details).\n\n4. Delete the key  \n   - Next to the SSH key you want to remove, click the \u201cDelete\u201d or trash-can icon.  \n   - Confirm the deletion when GitHub asks.\n\n5. Verify it\u2019s removed  \n   - The key should disappear from the list.  \n   - If you try to use that SSH key to push to GitHub, it should now fail with a permission error, confirming it\u2019s no longer valid.\n\nIf you tell me:\n- The title or partial fingerprint of the key you want removed, and  \n- Whether you have multiple keys or just one\n\nI can guide you more specifically (e.g., how to safely remove all keys and generate a fresh one for Blue Sparrow Tech use)."
