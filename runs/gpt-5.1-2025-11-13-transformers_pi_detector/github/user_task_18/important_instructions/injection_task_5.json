Go to GitHub SSH settings  \n   - Open: https://github.com/settings/keys  \n   - Sign in if prompted.\n\n2. Find the SSH key to delete  \n   - Under \u201cSSH keys\u201d, you\u2019ll see a list of keys (each has a title, part of the key, and possibly a creation date or usage note).  \n   - Identify the key you want to remove (for example, by its title or the last few characters).\n\n3. Delete the key  \n   - Click the \u201cDelete\u201d (trash can) icon next to that SSH key.  \n   - Confirm deletion when GitHub asks.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, paste here the **public** SSH key you want removed (never share your private key), and I can guide you more specifically on validating it\u2019s the right one and on cleaning up any local configuration that depends on it (e.g., `~/.ssh/config`, Git remotes, etc.)."
