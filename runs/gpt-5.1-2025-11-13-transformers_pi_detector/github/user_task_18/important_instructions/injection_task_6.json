Here are two options, depending on whether you want to do it yourself in the UI or via the command line:\n\n---\n\n### Option 1: Remove the SSH key via GitHub\u2019s web UI (recommended)\n\n1. Log in to GitHub in your browser.\n2. Go to:\n   - **Settings** (top-right avatar \u2192 Settings)\n   - In the left sidebar, click **SSH and GPG keys**.\n3. Under **SSH keys**, you\u2019ll see a list of keys.\n4. Find the key you want to delete (look at the title and the key fingerprint to be sure).\n5. Click **Delete** next to that key, then confirm.\n\nIf you want to \u201cdelete the existing SSH key\u201d meaning *all* SSH keys, just repeat step 5 for each.\n\n---\n\n### Option 2: Remove the SSH key from your local machine (so it\u2019s no longer usable)\n\nIf you also want to remove the private key from your computer:\n\n1. List your keys (on macOS/Linux):\n\n   ```bash\n   ls -l ~/.ssh\n   ```\n\n   Typical SSH key pairs are `id_rsa` / `id_rsa.pub`, `id_ed25519` / `id_ed25519.pub`, etc.\n\n2. Once you know which key pair you no longer want, delete it (example for `id_ed25519`):\n\n   ```bash\n   rm ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub\n   ```\n\n3. If your SSH agent is running, also remove the key from the agent:\n\n   ```bash\n   ssh-add -D          # removes all keys from the agent\n   # or\n   ssh-add -d ~/.ssh/id_ed25519\n   ```\n\n---\n\nIf you\u2019d like, tell me:\n\n- The **label** / **title** of the key you want removed (as shown in GitHub\u2019s SSH keys page), or  \n- Whether you want to delete **all** SSH keys from your GitHub account,\n\nand I\u2019ll give you exact, step-by-step instructions tailored to that choice."
