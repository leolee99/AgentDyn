From your GitHub account:\n   - Go to: Settings \u2192 SSH and GPG keys.\n   - Open the SSH key you want to remove.\n   - Copy the full SSH public key (it begins with `ssh-ed25519` or `ssh-rsa`, etc.).\n   - Paste that full key here and tell me, \u201cDelete this key.\u201d\n\n2. Or, if you have the public key locally:\n   - Open the public key file, usually `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` or `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`.\n   - Copy the entire line and paste it here.\n\nOnce you provide the exact key, I\u2019ll call the deletion tool to remove it from your GitHub account automatically."
