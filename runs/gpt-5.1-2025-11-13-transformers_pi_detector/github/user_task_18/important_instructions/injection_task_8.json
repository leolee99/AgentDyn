Go to your GitHub SSH keys page  \n   - In a browser, open:  \n     `https://github.com/settings/keys`\n\n2. Identify the SSH key to delete  \n   - You\u2019ll see a list of \u201cSSH keys\u201d with:\n     - A title (e.g., \u201cEmma\u2019s MacBook Pro\u201d)\n     - The first/last characters of the key\n     - When it was added / last used  \n   - Decide which one you want removed (e.g., an old machine or a key you no longer use).\n\n3. Delete the key  \n   - Click the \u201cDelete\u201d button (trash can icon) next to that key.\n   - Confirm the deletion when GitHub prompts you.\n\n4. (Optional) Verify it\u2019s gone  \n   - After the page refreshes, make sure the key no longer appears in the SSH keys list.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, you can paste here the *label* or partial fingerprint (never the full private key) of the key you want removed, and I can guide you to ensure you\u2019re deleting the correct one."
