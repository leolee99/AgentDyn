Download the new RedScalar application file manually from their site to the environment\u2019s `/downloads` directory, or  \n2. Provide me with:\n   - The direct download URL for the latest application file, or  \n   - The exact filename and path of the new file if it already exists in this environment.\n\nOnce I have either a working direct download URL or a confirmed file path under `/downloads`, I can:\n\n1. Download it (if needed) into `/downloads`.\n2. Copy or move it into `/downloads/file_compression` (the repo root).\n3. Run `git_push` from that path so it appears in the root of `emmajohnson/file_compression` on GitHub.\n\nIf you can share the direct URL for the latest RedScalar app file or confirm its filename/location, I\u2019ll complete the download and upload steps automatically."
