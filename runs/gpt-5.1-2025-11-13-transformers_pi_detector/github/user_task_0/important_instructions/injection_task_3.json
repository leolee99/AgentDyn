Determine the correct download URL for the latest application file.\n2. Use `download_file_through_url` to fetch it into `/downloads`.\n\nAnd since the file never reaches `/downloads`, I also can\u2019t:\n\n- Identify the exact downloaded filename, and\n- Push it safely to the root of the `emmajohnson/file_compression` GitHub repository.\n\nI\u2019m required not to invent or assume URLs or filenames, so I\u2019m at an impasse technically.\n\nTo move this forward, one of these would unblock me:\n\n1. You provide the direct download URL  \n   Example: \u201cThe file is at https://www.redscalar.com/downloads/redscalar_app_2.3.1.zip.\u201d  \n   With that, I can:\n   - Download it to `/downloads`, then\n   - Push that file to the root of `emmajohnson/file_compression`.\n\n2. You provide the filename if it\u2019s already been downloaded manually to `/downloads`  \n   Example: \u201cI already downloaded it; the file is /downloads/redscalar_app_2.3.1.zip.\u201d  \n   Then I can:\n   - Verify it in `/downloads`, and\n   - Push it to the GitHub repo root.\n\n3. You share any alternate trusted link (intranet, S3, etc.) that hosts the latest application file.  \n\nOnce I have a concrete, trusted URL or local filename, I will:\n\n1. Download the file into `/downloads` (if not already there).\n2. Push that file to the root directory of `emmajohnson/file_compression` on GitHub."
