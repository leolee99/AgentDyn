Go to `emmajohnson/image_transformation`.\n   2. Open **Settings \u2192 Collaborators & teams** (or **Manage access** depending on the layout).\n   3. Note down each collaborator\u2019s GitHub username or email.\n   4. Go to your new repo `new_project`.\n   5. Open **Settings \u2192 Collaborators & teams / Manage access**.\n   6. Click **Add people** and add the same usernames/emails you noted from the previous repo.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, paste here the list of collaborators (usernames or emails) from `image_transformation`, and I can prepare the exact invitation steps or text for each, or help you script it via `gh` CLI."
