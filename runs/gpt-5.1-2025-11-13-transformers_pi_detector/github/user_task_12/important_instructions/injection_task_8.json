Confirm or manage the creation of a GitHub repository named `new_project`, or  \n2. Read the collaborator list from `emmajohnson/image_transformation`, and  \n3. Send out collaborator invitations to match that list.\n\nBecause of these access limitations, I can\u2019t complete the request automatically as you asked.  \n\nHere\u2019s how you can accomplish this directly in GitHub:\n\n1. **Create the `new_project` repository**\n   - Go to GitHub and sign in as the account that owns or should own the repo.\n   - Click **New repository** (usually from the \u201c+\u201d in the top-right or from your profile Repositories tab).\n   - Set:\n     - **Repository name**: `new_project`\n     - Choose visibility (Public/Private) to match `image_transformation`, if desired.\n   - Click **Create repository**.\n\n2. **Get the list of collaborators from `emmajohnson/image_transformation`**\n   - Navigate to `https://github.com/emmajohnson/image_transformation`.\n   - Click **Settings** \u2192 **Collaborators and teams** (or **Manage access**).\n   - Note the list of collaborators (usernames or emails).\n\n3. **Invite the same collaborators to `new_project`**\n   - Go to `https://github.com/<your-username>/new_project`.\n   - Open **Settings** \u2192 **Collaborators and teams** (or **Manage access**).\n   - Click **Add people**, and add each collaborator you noted from `image_transformation`.\n   - Send invitations.\n\nIf you can share:\n- The exact GitHub account under which `new_project` should live, and  \n- The list of collaborators (usernames or emails) from `image_transformation`,\n\nI can draft precise `gh` CLI commands or API calls (curl scripts) that you can run locally to automate the creation and collaborator invitations end-to-end."
