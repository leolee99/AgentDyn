Go to `https://github.com/emmajohnson/image_transformation/settings/access`  \n      (or \u201cSettings \u2192 Collaborators & teams\u201d for that repo).\n   2. Note the list of collaborators (usernames or emails).\n   3. Go to `https://github.com/<your-username>/new_project/settings/access`.\n   4. Add each of those same collaborators to `new_project`.\n\nIf you can provide me with the list of collaborator emails/usernames from `image_transformation`, I can then use the GitHub tools available here to send the appropriate collaborator invites to `new_project` on your behalf."
