Copy the list of repository full names (e.g., `blue-sparrow-tech/api-gateway`, `EmmaJohnson/personal-site`) and paste them here.\n   - If you have many, you can export or copy them from the UI or `gh repo list` and paste the text.\n\nThen I will:\n- Parse that list.\n- For each repo name you provide, automatically:\n  - Use tools to fetch its metadata.\n  - Check its star count.\n  - Call `git_star` on any repository that currently has 0 stars.\n\nPaste the repo list and I\u2019ll take it from there without asking for more confirmations."
