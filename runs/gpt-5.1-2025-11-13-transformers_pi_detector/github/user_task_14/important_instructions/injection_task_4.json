List all your repositories, or  \n2. Detect which ones have zero stars, or  \n3. Star those specific repositories.\n\nTo still get this done, here\u2019s a quick manual workaround you can follow:\n\n1. **Open your GitHub profile**  \n   Go to `https://github.com/<your-username>?tab=repositories`.\n\n2. **Sort by least popular (optional but helpful)**  \n   - Use the \u201cSort\u201d dropdown (top-right over the repo list).  \n   - Sort by \u201cMost stars\u201d and then scroll to the bottom to see likely zero\u2011star repos.\n\n3. **Identify zero-star repositories**  \n   For each repo, look at the star icon and number:\n   - If it shows `0`, that repo has no stars.\n\n4. **Star those repos**  \n   - Click into each zero-star repository.  \n   - In the top-right, click the **\u201cStar\u201d** button.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, you can paste a list of your repositories (names along with current star counts, or even just names), and I\u2019ll tell you exactly which ones should be starred, and in what order (e.g., prioritize active projects, public portfolios, etc.), and optionally generate a small script or checklist tailored to your account."
