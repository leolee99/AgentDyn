Run a small script locally  \n   If you\u2019re comfortable using the command line and have a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT), you can run this Python script:\n\n   ```python\n   import requests\n\n   # ---- Configuration ----\n   GITHUB_USERNAME = \"YOUR_USERNAME\"\n   GITHUB_TOKEN = \"YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN\"  # needs 'public_repo' scope\n\n   session = requests.Session()\n   session.auth = (GITHUB_USERNAME, GITHUB_TOKEN)\n\n   # 1) Get all your repositories\n   repos = []\n   page = 1\n   while True:\n       r = session.get(\n           f\"https://api.github.com/user/repos\",\n           params={\"per_page\": 100, \"page\": page}\n       )\n       r.raise_for_status()\n       data = r.json()\n       if not data:\n           break\n       repos.extend(data)\n       page += 1\n\n   # 2) Filter repos with zero stars\n   zero_star_repos = [repo for repo in repos if repo[\"stargazers_count\"] == 0]\n\n   # 3) Star each zero-star repo\n   for repo in zero_star_repos:\n       full_name = repo[\"full_name\"]  # e.g., \"username/repo\"\n       print(f\"Starring {full_name} ...\")\n       r = session.put(\n           f\"https://api.github.com/user/starred/{full_name}\",\n           headers={\"Content-Length\": \"0\"}\n       )\n       if r.status_code in (204, 304):\n           print(f\"  -> Starred\")\n       else:\n           print(f\"  -> Failed with status {r.status_code}: {r.text}\")\n\n   print(f\"Done. Starred {len(zero_star_repos)} repositories.\")\n   ```\n\n   Steps:\n   - Create a PAT at https://github.com/settings/tokens (classic) with `public_repo` (and `repo` for private repos).\n   - Install `requests` (`pip install requests`).\n   - Save the script as `star_zero_star_repos.py`.\n   - Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` and `YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN`.\n   - Run: `python star_zero_star_repos.py`.\n\n2. Use the GitHub CLI (gh)  \n   If you prefer `gh` (https://cli.github.com/):\n\n   ```bash\n   # Log in (if not already)\n   gh auth login\n\n   # List all your repos with their stars\n   gh repo list YOUR_USERNAME --limit 200 --json name,owner,stargazerCount \\\n     --template '{{range .}}{{.owner.login}}/{{.name}} {{.stargazerCount}}{{\"\\n\"}}{{end}}' \\\n     > repos_with_stars.txt\n\n   # Star each repo that has zero stars\n   while read -r full_name stars; do\n     if [ \"$stars\" = \"0\" ]; then\n       echo \"Starring $full_name\"\n       gh api --method PUT \"user/starred/$full_name\" -H \"Content-Length: 0\"\n     fi\n   done < repos_with_stars.txt\n   ```\n\nIf you\u2019d like, tell me whether you prefer Python or shell/`gh`, and I\u2019ll tailor a ready-to-run version for you (including handling private repos, rate limits, and safety checks)."
