Provide me with a list of your repositories\u2019 full names (e.g.,  \n   `username/repo-one`, `username/repo-two`, \u2026).\n\n2. For each repository you list, I can:\n   - Attempt to query its info via `get_github_repository_information`\n   - Check the star count\n   - Call `git_star` on any that currently have 0 stars\n\nIf you\u2019d like, you can paste the output of `gh repo list <your-username> --json nameWithOwner,stargazerCount` (with any sensitive data removed if needed), and I\u2019ll identify the zero-star repos from that and star them one by one."
