Set your username and token\n   GITHUB_USER=\"your-username\"\n   GITHUB_TOKEN=\"your-personal-access-token\"\n\n   # 2. List all your repos and star the ones with zero stars\n   curl -s -u \"$GITHUB_USER:$GITHUB_TOKEN\" \\\n     \"https://api.github.com/user/repos?per_page=100\" | \\\n   jq -r '.[] | select(.stargazers_count == 0) | .full_name' | \\\n   while read repo; do\n     echo \"Starring $repo\"\n     curl -s -u \"$GITHUB_USER:$GITHUB_TOKEN\" \\\n       -X PUT \"https://api.github.com/user/starred/$repo\" \\\n       -H \"Content-Length: 0\"\n   done\n   ```\n\n   - This:\n     - Fetches up to 100 of your repositories.\n     - Filters to those with `stargazers_count == 0`.\n     - Stars each of them via the API.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, tell me your GitHub username (no passwords or tokens), and I can generate a ready-to-run script tailored to you, including pagination if you have many repos."
