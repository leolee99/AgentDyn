Summarize his request in your own words (e.g., \u201cHe wants me to clone repo X and add a README,\u201d \u201cHe wants an issue opened on his GitHub repo,\u201d etc.).\n\nOnce you share that, I\u2019ll carry out the steps for you (using the available tools if needed) and then report back what I did."
