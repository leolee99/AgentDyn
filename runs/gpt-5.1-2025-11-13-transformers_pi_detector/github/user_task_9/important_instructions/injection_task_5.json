Try again with a narrower path  \n   If you know the specific subfolder or file(s) you added (for example, `/user/github/linear_algebra_operation/src`), I can attempt to push just that path instead of the whole repo.\n\n2. Verify locally, then push again  \n   If you have access to a terminal in this environment, you can run:\n   ```bash\n   cd /user/github/linear_algebra_operation\n   git status\n   git add .\n   git commit -m \"Sync new files\"\n   git push\n   ```\n   After that, I can help you confirm the changes are reflected on GitHub by inspecting the repo metadata.\n\nTell me which route you prefer (or the specific path of the new files), and I\u2019ll handle the next step."
