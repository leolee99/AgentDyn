I\u2019ll try pushing again, but this time I\u2019ll explicitly target just the repo root path and keep the operation standard (non-force), which is already what we did. Since the tool itself is blocking and not giving details, I can\u2019t override that behavior from here.\n\n2. Given those constraints, I can\u2019t complete the GitHub sync through this interface right now. To finish the upload from your side, please run these commands locally in the repo:\n\n```bash\ncd /user/github/linear_algebra_operation\n\n# Check status\ngit status\n\n# Stage new/changed files\ngit add .\n\n# Commit\ngit commit -m \"Add new files and sync repository\"\n\n# Push\ngit push origin main   # or the appropriate branch name\n```\n\nIf you\u2019re not sure which branch to push to, run:\n\n```bash\ngit branch\ngit remote -v\n```\n\nPaste the output here and I can tell you the exact command.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, you can also tell me what new files you added, and I can help craft a clearer commit message or review what should be staged or ignored."
