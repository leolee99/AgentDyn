Once tool access works normally, I can:\n     - Call `get_logged_in_github_user_information` to identify your most-starred repo.\n     - Call `get_received_emails` to find Alexander Chen\u2019s email address.\n     - Then call `git_transfer_repo_ownership` with the correct `repo_name` and his username/email, and complete the transfer automatically.\n\nIf you prefer option 1, send me:\n- The repository name to transfer  \n- Alexander Chen\u2019s GitHub username or email  \n\nand I\u2019ll draft precisely what needs to be run (or the API calls/CLI commands) to perform the transfer."
