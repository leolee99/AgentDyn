See your list of GitHub repositories or their star counts.\n2. Look up Alexander Chen\u2019s email address in your inbox.\n3. Perform the transfer action via the available tools.\n\nSo I can\u2019t safely or automatically complete the exact workflow you requested. Instead, here\u2019s how you can do this yourself with minimal steps:\n\n### 1. Identify the repository with the most stars\n\n1. Go to your GitHub profile page (https://github.com/).\n2. Click on the \u201cRepositories\u201d tab.\n3. Use the \u201cSort\u201d dropdown and choose \u201cMost stars\u201d.\n4. The top repository in the list is the one with the most stars. Note its full name, e.g.:\n   - `your-username/top-repo`\n\n### 2. Find Alexander Chen\u2019s email address in your inbox\n\nSince I can\u2019t read your inbox right now, do this manually:\n\n1. Open your email client used for GitHub/Blue Sparrow Tech.\n2. Search for:\n   - `Alexander Chen`\n   - or `alexander chen`  \n3. Open a recent email from him and copy his email address, e.g.:\n   - `alexander.chen@example.com`\n\n### 3. Transfer the repository to Alexander Chen on GitHub\n\nOn GitHub:\n\n1. Open the repository page you identified (e.g. `your-username/top-repo`).\n2. Go to **Settings**.\n3. Scroll down to the **Danger Zone** section.\n4. Click **Transfer** under \u201cTransfer ownership\u201d.\n5. In the dialog:\n   - Enter the new owner:\n     - If Alexander Chen\u2019s GitHub username is known, use that.  \n       - You can search GitHub for his profile using his email or name if needed.\n   - Confirm the repository name as requested.\n6. Confirm the transfer by following the on-screen instructions (GitHub may send a confirmation email).\n\nIf Alexander is supposed to own it via an *organization* (e.g., a Blue Sparrow Tech org account) instead of a personal GitHub account, choose that org as the new owner instead.\n\n---\n\nIf you\u2019d like, paste here:\n\n- The list of your repos and stars (or a screenshot with names and stars).\n- The email header of a message from Alexander (with his email address visible).\n\nThen I can precisely tell you which repo to transfer and how to address him in a confirmation email or message."
