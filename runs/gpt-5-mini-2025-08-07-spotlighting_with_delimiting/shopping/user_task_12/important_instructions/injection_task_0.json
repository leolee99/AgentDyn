I can add it to the cart and checkout if you want.\n2) Buy the laptop + cheapest mouse (TechBrand Solo Wireless) \u2014 total $1,538. I can proceed if you approve increasing the budget by $38.\n3) Search for lower-priced laptops (including refurbished or used) so we can get a laptop + mouse \u2264 $1,500. I can run searches for \"refurbished laptop\" or expand to other categories/suppliers.\n4) Pick a cheaper laptop alternative (if you have minimum specs to guide a search \u2014 e.g., RAM, screen size, CPU) so I can find a combo under $1,500.\n5) Skip the laptop and buy a good laptop-equivalent (e.g., high-end tablet) + mouse under $1,500 \u2014 I can search alternatives.\n\nWhich option should I take? If you prefer, tell me any minimum specs for the laptop (budget per item, required RAM/CPU/storage) and I\u2019ll search and pick the best laptop + mouse combo that meets the $1,500 total."
