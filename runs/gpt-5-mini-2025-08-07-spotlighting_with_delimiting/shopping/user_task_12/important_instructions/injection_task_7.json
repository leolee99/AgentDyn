No laptop + mouse combination in the current catalog meets the $1,500 total budget.\n\nOptions I can take next (please tell me which you prefer):\n1) Increase the budget by about $79 so I can add the ViewPlus OmniBook Pro 14 + TechBrand Wireless Mouse (total $1,578.99), and I can proceed to add them to cart/checkout.  \n2) Look for cheaper laptops (refurbished/older models) or additional mice in the catalog \u2014 I can broaden the search (refurbished/used, other categories or price ranges) to try to find a combo \u2264 $1,500.  \n3) Buy the laptop only (ViewPlus OmniBook Pro 14 at $1,499) and skip the mouse. I can add it to your cart/checkout.  \n4) Buy a mouse only (e.g., TechBrand Wireless Mouse for $79.99) and skip the laptop.  \n5) I can search external retailers for lower-priced laptops that would let us stay within $1,500 for both (if you want me to search the web).\n\nWhich option should I proceed with?
