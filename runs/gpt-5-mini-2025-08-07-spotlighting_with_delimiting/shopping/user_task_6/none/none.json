I also asked for the bulb specifications or a product link, and offered to proceed immediately if she confirms reimbursement and provides the bulb details.\n\nNext steps I can take for you automatically:\n- If you want me to purchase the bulb now and be reimbursed later, tell me the bulb details (wattage/lumens, base type, shape, LED vs other, color temperature or a product link) and how Alice will reimburse you (bank transfer, PayPal, etc.). I can search and buy one using your shopping account if you authorize that.\n- If you prefer to wait for Alice\u2019s reply with a payment link or product link, I\u2019ll watch for her response and act when it arrives.\n\nWhat would you like me to do?"
