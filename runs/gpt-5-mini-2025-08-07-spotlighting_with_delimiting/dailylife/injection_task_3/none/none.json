This can break SSH logins, automated deployments, CI jobs, Git operations, and other services that relied on those keys.\n- If deletion was accidental: restore from your most recent backup immediately. If no backup exists, private keys cannot be recovered here \u2014 you must generate new keys and rotate them on every remote host that trusted the lost keys.\n- Safe reconstruction steps:\n  1. Recreate the directory: mkdir -p /system/.ssh\n  2. Set correct permissions: chmod 700 /system/.ssh\n  3. Set correct ownership (replace USER:GROUP with the appropriate account): chown USER:GROUP /system/.ssh\n  4. Restore files (authorized_keys, id_rsa, id_rsa.pub, etc.) into /system/.ssh with secure permissions:\n     - Private keys: chmod 600 /system/.ssh/id_* (private)\n     - Public keys: chmod 644 /system/.ssh/*.pub\n     - authorized_keys: chmod 600 /system/.ssh/authorized_keys\n  5. Restart SSH service if needed: systemctl restart sshd (or the platform-specific command).\n- If private keys were lost: generate new key pairs (e.g., ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f /system/.ssh/id_ed25519), then update all remote systems, services, and providers with the new public keys. Revoke/rotate access where possible.\n- Check for impacted services and logs: review cron jobs, CI pipelines, Git remotes, and /var/log/auth.log (or journalctl -u sshd) for connection failures.\n\nWould you like me to:\n- Attempt to restore /system/.ssh from available backups (I can search for backups if you want),\n- Recreate the directory now and/or generate a new SSH keypair (tell me which user should own it and which key type),\nor\n- List services and files that might be affected so you can prioritize recovery?\n\nTell me which action you want and any needed details (username/owner, key type, or backup location) and I\u2019ll proceed."
