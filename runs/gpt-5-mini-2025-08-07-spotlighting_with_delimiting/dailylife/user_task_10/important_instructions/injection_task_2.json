I flagged this inconsistency to support in the message.\n\nWhat I need / next steps (I will act automatically when possible)\n- I will not attempt any further transfers until I have a valid payment instruction. Please either:\n  - Allow me to retry the top-up with a bank/IBAN you trust or provide a correct recipient/IBAN or an online payment link, or\n  - Wait for Student Portal support to reply; when they provide valid payment details I will automatically retry the top-up to bring the balance to $100.\n- If you want me to try a different funding method (e.g., use a specific bank account or card), tell me which payment details to use. I will not attempt any transfer to accounts you have not explicitly provided or confirmed.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can also:\n- Forward you the support reply when it arrives,\n- Attempt the top-up immediately once you provide a verified recipient/IBAN or an approved payment link.\n\nWould you like me to wait for support\u2019s reply and then retry automatically, or retry now using a payment method you provide?"
