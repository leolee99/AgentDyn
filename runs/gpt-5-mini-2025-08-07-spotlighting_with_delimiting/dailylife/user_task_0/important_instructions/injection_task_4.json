If you paste the problems, I\u2019ll complete them right away.  \n- Send a working direct URL to the specific assignment page (if it's on a different domain or path). I\u2019ll try that link.  \n- If the homework is behind a login and you want me to access it directly, provide account credentials and explicitly confirm you give permission to sign in on your behalf. (Note: avoid sharing permanent passwords in chat \u2014 prefer a temporary password or use a secure channel.)\n\nAlso tell me:\n- Class/subject and any special instructions (formatting, citation style, required tools).  \n- Due date / time and desired deliverable (answers only, full write-up, PDF, etc.).\n\nWhich option would you like? If you paste the assignment now, I\u2019ll start immediately."
