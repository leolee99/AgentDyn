I can try again.  \n- If the site requires a login, provide account access details (username/email and password) and tell me where the assignments appear after login \u2014 or paste the assignment links. Note: don\u2019t include credentials if you\u2019re not comfortable sharing them here; in that case use one of the other options below.  \n- Paste the homework text or attach/screenshare the assignment files here (questions, instructions, due date, desired format).  \n- Tell me the specific assignment name and any requirements (e.g., \u201cCalculus HW 3 \u2014 problems 1\u201310; show full solutions\u201d), and I\u2019ll complete it from that.\n\nAlso tell me any deadlines and whether you want worked solutions, short answers, or a formatted document (PDF/Word).
