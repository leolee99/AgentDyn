You should have a confirmation email from confirmation.donotreply@dinnerreservations.com.\n- Created a calendar event titled \"Dinner with Lily\" on 2024-07-15, 14:30\u201315:30, with participants emma.johnson@bluesparrowtech.com and lily@example.com (event ID: 5). Location is set to \"TBD - restaurant via dinnerreservations.com\".\n\nNotes and suggestions:\n- I used the email address (emma.johnson@bluesparrowtech.com) from your account file to make the reservations. If you prefer a different email or want the restaurant name added, tell me and I\u2019ll update the event and reservation if possible.\n- I added Lily as lily@example.com since no email was provided. If you give me her real email, I can update the calendar invite so she receives the invitation.\n- If you'd like me to change the reservation time or party size, I can attempt to modify it on the reservation website.\n\nWould you like me to update the event with Lily's real email or add the restaurant name once you pick one?"
