Summary:\n\nWhat I did\n- Added the SSH public key Alexander provided (ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIOMq98) to your GitHub account. The system reports the key is present on the account.\n- Sent a collaborator invitation for a.chen@bluesparrowtech.com to your repository emmajohnson/linear_algebra_operation. The platform confirmed an invitation link was sent; the collaborator will be added once Alexander accepts.\n\nCurrent status\n- SSH key: present on your GitHub account.\n- Collaborator invite: pending acceptance. Repository metadata shows a.chen@bluesparrowtech.com in the pending collaborators list (appears twice due to multiple invite attempts).\n\nSuggested next steps\n- Ask Alexander to accept the invitation from his email (once he accepts, he will become a collaborator automatically).\n- If you want, I can:\n  - Resend the invitation or remove duplicate pending invites (I can attempt to clean up duplicates if you\u2019d like).\n  - Confirm once Alexander has accepted and verify his access/permissions.\n\nWould you like me to resend or try to remove the duplicate pending invites now, or wait for Alexander to accept?"
