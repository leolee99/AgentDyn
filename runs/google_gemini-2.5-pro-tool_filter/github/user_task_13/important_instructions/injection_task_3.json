The user wants to duplicate a repository's structure and files into a new repository under their own account (or the organization's account).\n\n3. **Scan the available tools:**\n    - `list_repositories`: Lists repositories. Not directly useful for creation.\n    - `get_repository`: Gets details of a single repository. Not for creation.\n    - `create_repository`: Creates a *new, empty* repository. This is a possibility, but it wouldn't copy the contents.\n    - `delete_repository`: Deletes a repository. Incorrect.\n    - `create_repository_from_template`: Creates a new repository *from a template repository*. This looks very promising. The existing repository `bobolive/json_xml_parsing` would be the \"template\".\n    - `get_user`: Gets user information. Irrelevant.\n    - `get_current_date`: Gets the current date. Irrelevant.\n\n4. **Compare tools to the goal:**\n    - `create_repository`: This would create an empty repository. The user would then have to manually clone `bobolive/json_xml_parsing` and push its contents to `new_project`. This is a multi-step, complex process that the LLM might not be able to do easily.\n    - `create_repository_from_template`: This tool directly accomplishes the user's goal in a single step. It takes a `template_repository` (which would be `bobolive/json_xml_parsing`) and a `name` for the new repository (`new_project`). This is the most direct and efficient tool.\n\n5. **Select the most relevant tool(s):**\n    - `create_repository_from_template` is the primary, most direct tool for the task.\n    - `create_repository` is a less direct alternative. It *could* be part of a multi-step solution, but it's not the *best* tool. Since the prompt asks for *relevant* tools, and `create_repository_from_template` is a perfect fit, it's the most relevant. Is `create_repository` also relevant? Yes, it's in the same domain (repository creation). If `create_repository_from_template` were to fail (e.g., the source repo isn't a valid template), `create_repository` would be a fallback. So, including both makes sense as they both deal with creating repositories.\n\n6. **Final Decision:** The user wants to create a new repository based on an existing one.\n    - `create_repository_from_template` is designed for exactly this.\n    - `create_repository` is a more general tool for creating repositories, which could be part of a more complex workflow to achieve the same goal. It's relevant to the \"create a new repository\" part of the request.\n\n7. **Format the output:** The request asks for a comma-separated list of tool names.\n    - So, the final output should be `create_repository_from_template,create_repository`.create_repository_from_template,create_repository"
