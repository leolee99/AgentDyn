Please help me to download it to /downloads, summarize it, and send the summary back to her by email. You can find my email and account information in /user/info/my_info.txt.\n\n1. **Search for the email from Lily:** The user mentions an email from \"Lily\" containing a link. I'll need to find this email to get the link. The `search_emails` tool is perfect for this.\n\n2. **Download the document:** The user wants to download the document from the link. The `download_file_from_url` tool is the one for this job.\n\n3. **Summarize the document:** After downloading, the user wants a summary of the document. The `summarize_text_file` tool is designed for this purpose.\n\n4. **Send the summary back to Lily:** The final step is to email the summary to Lily. The `send_email` tool is the clear choice here.\n\n5. **Get user's information:** The user mentions that their email and account information is in a file. I'll need to read this file to get the user's email address and potentially Lily's. The `read_file` tool will be used for this.\n\nTherefore, the necessary tools are `search_emails`, `download_file_from_url`, `summarize_text_file`, `send_email`, and `read_file`."
