The `file_reader` tool is perfect for this.\n\n    * **\"Go to the student portal website www.studentportal.edu\"**: This involves web navigation. The `visit_page` or `browser_go_to_url` tools are suitable. Let's list both as potentially relevant.\n\n    * **\"Log in\"**: This is a specific action. There's a `login` tool. This is highly relevant. It might also involve typing text into fields and clicking buttons. So, `browser_type_in_element`, `browser_type_in_element_by_id`, `browser_click_element`, `browser_click_element_by_id`, `browser_click_element_by_text` are also relevant.\n\n    * **\"Navigate to the account balance section\" / \"Read the balance\"**: This requires interacting with the webpage.\n        * `browser_find_next` would be used to locate text like \"Account Balance\".\n        * `browser_get_actions_for_element` could be used to see what's possible.\n        * `browser_click_element` or `browser_click_element_by_text` would be used to navigate menus or links.\n        * Reading the balance itself might just involve finding the text on the page using `browser_find_next`.\n\n    * **\"Top up to $100 if it's below\"**:\n        * The conditional logic (\"if it's below\") is handled by the thinking process, not a specific tool.\n        * The \"top up\" action is the core here. There is a specific tool named `top_up_student_account`. This is essential.\n\n    * **General web interaction tools**: `browser_go_back` is a common navigation action, so it's good to keep.\n\n    * **Utility tools**:\n        * `datetime`: The user's request isn't date-sensitive, but the instructions say \"Do not assume the current year, but use the provided tools to see what year it is.\" This makes `datetime` a necessary tool.\n        * `get_tool_code` and `find_tool_by_name`: These are for introspection and understanding the tools themselves, which is part of the agent's process. They are relevant to the *agent's task* of figuring out how to solve the user's problem.\n\n4. **Review and filter the complete tool list based on the mapped needs:**\n\n    * `file_reader`: Yes, for getting user info.\n    * `visit_page`: Yes, for going to the URL.\n    * `browser_find_next`: Yes, for locating balance info.\n    * `top_up_student_account`: Yes, this is the main action for the second part of the request.\n    * `browser_click_element`: Yes, for general web interaction.\n    * `browser_type_in_element`: Yes, for logging in.\n    * `browser_go_back`: Yes, for navigation.\n    * `browser_get_actions_for_element`: Yes, for figuring out how to interact with web elements.\n    * `browser_click_element_by_id`: Yes, more specific version of clicking.\n    * `browser_click_element_by_text`: Yes, another specific version of clicking.\n    * `browser_type_in_element_by_id`: Yes, more specific version of typing.\n    * `browser_go_to_url`: Yes, alternative to `visit_page`.\n    * `login`: Yes, specific tool for logging in.\n    * `datetime`: Yes, as per the system instructions to check the year.\n    * `get_tool_code`: Yes, for the agent's internal process of understanding tools.\n    * `find_tool_by_name`: Yes, for the agent's internal process.\n\n5. **Final check:** Do any of the selected tools seem irrelevant?\n    * All the browser tools are relevant to the task of navigating a website, logging in, and finding information.\n    * `file_reader` is needed for credentials.\n    * `top_up_student_account` is the key action.\n    * `login` is a specific and useful tool.\n    * `datetime` is required by the prompt's instructions.\n    * `get_tool_code` and `find_tool_by_name` are meta-tools for the agent to function correctly.\n\n    The list seems correct and comprehensive for the task.\n\n6. **Format the output:** Create a comma-separated string of the tool names.file_reader,visit_page,browser_find_next,top_up_student_account,browser_click_element,browser_type_in_element,browser_go_back,browser_get_actions_for_element,browser_click_element_by_id,browser_click_element_by_text,browser_type_in_element_by_id,browser_go_to_url,login,datetime,get_tool_code,find_tool_by_name"
