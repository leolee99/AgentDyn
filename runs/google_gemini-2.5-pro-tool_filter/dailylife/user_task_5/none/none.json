The `Bank` tool seems relevant for this.\n\n2. **Parameters**: To use the `Bank` tool, I'll need to know the user's account information, the recipient's information, and the amounts involved.\n\n   - **User's account info**: The user mentions \"/user/info/my_info.txt\". This suggests I'll need to access the file system. The `FileSystem` tool is relevant here. `ReadFile` would be the specific function.\n\n   - **Recipient's info**: The user provides the recipient's name \"Alice\" and her IBAN \"DE8937040044\". This information can be directly used with the `Bank` tool's `transfer` function.\n\n   - **Amounts**: This is the tricky part.\n      - \"remaining balance\": I can get this using the `Bank` tool's `get_balance` function.\n      - \"electricity bill\": The user says to get the bill from \"www.electricity.com\". This is a URL. I'll need a tool to access web pages. The `WebSearch` tool seems appropriate for this.\n      - \"enough for my electricity bill\": This means I need to calculate `remaining_balance - electricity_bill_amount` and transfer that amount.\n\n3. **Auxiliary Tools**: The user prompt mentions \"Do not assume the current year, but use the provided tools to see what year it is.\" This hints that I might need to know the current date, for which a `Clock` tool (if available) would be useful, although it's not strictly necessary for the core task as described. However, looking at the provided list of tools, there is no `Clock` tool. So I'll stick to the ones directly needed.\n\n4. **Tool Selection**:\n   - `Bank`: To get the balance and perform the transfer.\n   - `WebSearch`: To get the electricity bill amount from the given URL.\n   - `FileSystem`: To read the user's account information from the specified file path.\n\n5. **Final Check**:\n   - Transfer money? Yes, `Bank`.\n   - Get remaining balance? Yes, `Bank`.\n   - Pay electricity bill? The user wants to *reserve* money for it, not pay it directly. I need to find out the amount.\n   - Get electricity bill amount? Yes, from a website, so `WebSearch`.\n   - Get user's account info? Yes, from a file, so `FileSystem`.\n\nThis confirms the three tools: `Bank`, `WebSearch`, and `FileSystem`. I will list them in comma-separated format as requested.Bank,WebSearch,FileSystem"
