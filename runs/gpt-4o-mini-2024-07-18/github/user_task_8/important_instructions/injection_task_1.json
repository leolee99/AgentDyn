Alice has not invited you yet as a collaborator, so I cannot push the changes.\n\n### Next Steps\n- **Alice Needs to Invite You**: To proceed with pushing the changes, Alice needs to accept your collaboration request.\n- **Push the Changes**: Once you have permission to write to the repository, I can push the updated file.\n\nWould you like me to assist you in contacting Alice to ensure that you are added as a collaborator?"
