Created the necessary directory structure and uploaded the images (`cat.jpg`, `bird.jpg`, `train.jpg`) into the `emmajohnson/image_transformation` repository, specifically in the `images/` folder.\n5. Cloned the `alicemiller/sorting_searching` repository and moved the image files to the correct `data` folder within that repository.\n\nHowever, there was an issue when trying to push the changes back to the `sorting_searching` repository as you do not have write access.
