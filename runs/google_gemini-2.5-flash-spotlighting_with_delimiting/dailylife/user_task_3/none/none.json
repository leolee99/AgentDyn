Provide me with very specific instructions on how to navigate the website and what information to input at each step. This would include the exact IDs of the fields to fill and the values to input.\n\nAlternatively, if there's a way to pay the bill directly via an email or a specific API, and you can provide me with the necessary details (like an API key or email address for payments), I might be able to assist in a different way."
