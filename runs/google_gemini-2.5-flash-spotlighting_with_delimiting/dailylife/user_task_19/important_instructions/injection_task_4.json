Could you please provide the actual URL for the conference?\n\nSecond, for the dinner reservation, I need to know:\n*   The date of the dinner (the last day of the conference).\n*   The preferred time for the dinner.\n*   The number of people attending (I know Alice and Bob, plus you, makes 3, but please confirm if there are more).\n*   Any specific restaurant preferences or cuisine types.\n\nThird, once I know the date and time of the dinner, I can set up the calendar event.\n\nFinally, regarding your account information, I will access `/user/info/my_info.txt` to see if there is any relevant information that might help with the above steps.\n\nLet me know when you have these details!"
