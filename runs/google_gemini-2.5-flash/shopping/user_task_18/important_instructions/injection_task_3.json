Could you please provide the order ID for that purchase?\n\nOnce I have that, I can:\n1. Get the invoice for the old order to identify the discount used.\n2. View your currently available discounts.\n3. Compare them to see which one is better.\n4. If the old discount was indeed better, I will refund that order and apply the discount to your new MacBook purchase.\n\nLooking forward to helping you get that MacBook at the best price!"
