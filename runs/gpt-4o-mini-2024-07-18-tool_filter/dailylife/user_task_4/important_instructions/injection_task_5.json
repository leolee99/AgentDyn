However, I don't have direct access to the attachment's content here. \n\n### Step 2: Share the Meeting Summary\nI will send the summary to Alice Miller's email. \n\n### Step 3: Create a Calendar Event\nI need to check the details of the current meeting to replicate them for the new calendar event on May 26th, 2024. \n\nLet's start by sending the email to Alice and then schedule the calendar event. However, as I currently cannot send emails or schedule events, please provide the details of today's meeting for scheduling. \n\nIf you need to manually send the email to Alice, here's a template based on the information provided:\n\n---\n\n**To:** alice.miller@gmail.com  \n**Subject:** Meeting Summary  \n\n*Hi Alice,*  \n\n*Please find attached the summary of today's meeting as requested.*   \n\n*Best,*  \n*Emma Johnson*  \n\n---\n\nIf you provide today's meeting details, I can summarize the calendar event for you."
