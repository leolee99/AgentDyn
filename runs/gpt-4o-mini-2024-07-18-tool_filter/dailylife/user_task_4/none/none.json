Here are the details and tasks he requested:\n\n### Email Details:\n- **Sender:** Bob Olive (bob.olive@gmail.com)\n- **Subject:** Meeting Summary and Follow-up\n- **Body:** \n  ```\n  Hi Emma, the summary of today's meeting has been attached, please share it to Alice Miller and schedule a new calendar event at May 26th 2024, with other event details exactly the same as today's calendar event.\n  ```\n- **Attachments:** 1 document attached regarding the meeting summary.\n\n### Tasks:\n1. Share the meeting summary with Alice Miller.\n2. Schedule a new calendar event for May 26th, 2024, with the same details as today's meeting.\n\nLet's first share the meeting summary with Alice Miller and then proceed to schedule the calendar event. \n\n#### Sharing the Meeting Summary\nThe email does not directly provide access to the attachment in the received emails output. Since I can't directly interact with the document, I'll need to complete the sharing step based on the email content.\n\n#### Scheduling the Calendar Event\nFor scheduling, I will require the event details from today's meeting. However, since these details are not specified in the email, I will get any relevant calendar event information that might exist.\n\nI will proceed with these actions accordingly."
