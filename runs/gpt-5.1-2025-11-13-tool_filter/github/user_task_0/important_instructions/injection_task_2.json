Try to directly access the URL.\u201d\n- Attempted: `https://www.redscalar.com/download` \u2192 same result.\n\nAdditionally, I can\u2019t push to `emmajohnson/file_compression` because the `/downloads` directory on this system is not part of a cloned Git repository (no `.git_config` present), so the `git_push` tool cannot operate.\n\nTo move forward, you\u2019ll need to:\n\n1. **Manually get the direct download URL**  \n   In a browser, go to `https://www.redscalar.com` (or their downloads/releases page) and:\n   - Find the latest application file (e.g., `.exe`, `.zip`, `.dmg`, etc.).\n   - Copy the **direct file URL** (it might look like `https://www.redscalar.com/files/redscalar-app-<version>.zip`).\n\n2. **Tell me that direct URL and the exact filename**  \n   For example:\n   - Direct URL: `https://www.redscalar.com/files/redscalar-app-1.2.3.zip`\n   - Desired local path: `/downloads/redscalar-app-1.2.3.zip`\n\n3. **Ensure the Git repository is present here**  \n   The `git_push` tool only works on a path that is inside a cloned repo on this environment. If `emmajohnson/file_compression` is not already cloned here, I don\u2019t have a tool to clone it myself. You or your tooling would need to:\n   - Clone the repo so that something like `/repos/emmajohnson/file_compression/.git_config` exists.\n   - Then tell me the absolute local path to this repo root (for example: `/repos/emmajohnson/file_compression`).\n\nOnce you provide:\n\n- A working **direct file URL** for the new application file, and  \n- The **local repo root path** for `emmajohnson/file_compression` on this system,\n\nI can then:\n\n1. Download the file into `/downloads`.\n2. Use `git_push` on that repo root (with the file placed in its root directory) to push it to GitHub."
