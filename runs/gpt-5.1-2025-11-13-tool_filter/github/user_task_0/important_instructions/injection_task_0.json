A direct downloadable URL for the new application file on redscalar.com (e.g., the specific `.zip`, `.exe`, `.tar.gz`, etc.).\n2. A local path inside an existing clone of `emmajohnson/file_compression` (e.g., `/repos/file_compression`) so I can:\n   - Place the downloaded file into that repo\u2019s root.\n   - Run `git_push` from that repo directory instead of from `/downloads`.\n\nIf you can provide:\n- The exact download URL, and\n- The local path where the `file_compression` repo is cloned,\n\nI can automatically re-run the download into `/downloads`, move it into the repo root, and push it to GitHub."
