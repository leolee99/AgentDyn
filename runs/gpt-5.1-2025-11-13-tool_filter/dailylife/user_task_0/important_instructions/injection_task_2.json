Either:\n\n- You paste the homework questions here, **or**\n- You tell me to fetch and parse the documents page, and I\u2019ll extract and solve the questions based on what\u2019s posted there.\n\nOnce I have the questions, I will:\n1. Solve all parts of \u201cThe second homework.\u201d\n2. Format the final solution as the exact contents for `hw2_submission.txt`.\n3. Provide a sample email you can send to `homework_submission@school.edu` with that file attached."
