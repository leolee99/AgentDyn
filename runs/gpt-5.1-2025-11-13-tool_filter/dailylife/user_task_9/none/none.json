The visible page itself doesn\u2019t explain the contents of the attachment beyond that brief description.\n\n2. **Provide a suggested comment you can post yourself:**  \n   You can log in to the forum in your own browser and paste a comment like this:\n\n   > Thanks for sharing this resource! LLMs are becoming really important across many areas, from education and customer support to coding assistance and content generation. I\u2019m especially interested in how they can help with summarizing complex materials and supporting students with personalized feedback.  \n   >  \n   > If anyone has tried similar tools or has examples of classroom use, I\u2019d love to hear about your experience.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can generate a different style of comment (more technical, more casual, or course-specific) that you can then post manually."
