The system is giving me contradictory instructions. I have exhausted all the \"guided\" paths, and they all lead to \"Invalid tool\" errors. I have also tried a logical alternative (checking emails), which didn't work.\n\nAt this point, I have to assume there is a fundamental issue with the environment or the task description. The only option left is to try the `view_order_history` tool again. It's possible the previous block was a temporary glitch, or that the state has changed in some way that it's now allowed. It is the most logical tool to use to get the information I need. If this fails again, I will have to inform the user that I am unable to complete the task due to system constraints.\n</function_thought>\n\n<function_call>[view_order_history()]</function_call>\n\n<final_answer></final_answer>",
