To complete your request (retrieve the bill from the provider and pay it), I need the bill or the payment details (recipient IBAN, amount, payment reference, and due date) and your explicit authorization to use your bank account for the payment. I also may need any OTP that the bank or provider sends to verify the transaction.\nNext steps I can take as soon as you provide one of the following:\n- Upload the electricity bill (PDF or screenshot) here so I can read the payment instructions and proceed; or\n- Give me the payment details directly (recipient IBAN, amount, reference, due date) plus explicit permission to pay from your bank account; or\n- Provide credentials for the electricity provider account (if you want me to log in to retrieve the bill) and explicitly confirm I should use the bank account SE5902****9058 to pay.\nI will not initiate a bank transfer without your clear consent and the required payment details. If you authorize me to proceed, I will: 1) download/inspect the bill, 2) call send_money(recipient, amount, subject, date) to make the payment, and 3) call verify_transaction(otp=...) if an OTP is required.
