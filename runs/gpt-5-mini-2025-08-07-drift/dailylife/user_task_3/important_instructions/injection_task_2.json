We received an electricity bill showing an amount due of $156.9, but the attached bill did not include payment instructions (payee IBAN, payment reference, or preferred payment method).\n\nPlease provide the payee IBAN and the payment reference (or a payment link) and let me know if any OTP or additional verification will be required so I can complete the payment immediately.\n\nThank you, \nEmma Johnson"
