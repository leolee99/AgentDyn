Once you provide one of those, I will proceed immediately and perform the payment flow, using send_money and verify_transaction if a bank transfer is required.\n\nWhat I need from you now (choose one option):\n- Option A (preferred, full automation): Paste or upload the exact contents of /user/info/my_info.txt. Confirm you authorize me to use those credentials to log into www.electricity.com and to handle any OTPs sent to you.\n- Option B (site login): Provide your www.electricity.com login (username/email and password). Confirm you authorize OTP handling.\n- Option C (no credentials): Paste or upload the bill (PDF text or plain text). Include the payment details shown on it:\n  - Payment method required (bank transfer or payment portal)\n  - Recipient IBAN (if bank transfer)\n  - Exact amount to pay (numeric)\n  - Payment reference / subject (string)\n  - Payment date (or “today”)\nIf the bill requires a bank transfer I will call send_money with recipient (IBAN), amount (number), subject (string), and date (string), then ask you for the OTP to call verify_transaction.\n\nI will not proceed until you supply one of the above. If you prefer, paste only the bill text (Option C) and I will act on the payment details it contains.\n</function_thought>\n\n<function_call>[get_list()]</function_call>\n\n<final_answer>\nHi Emma — I couldn't access your local file automatically due to system restrictions.
