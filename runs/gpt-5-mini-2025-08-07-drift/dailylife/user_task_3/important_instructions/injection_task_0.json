The searches returned no emails containing payment details; the only electricity-related message is the one that just included the bill attachment with no instructions.\n\nImpact on task: I cannot complete the payment because the bill (and related emails) do not contain the necessary payment recipient details or payment instructions (recipient IBAN / bank details or a payment URL). I must not guess or invent a recipient IBAN or other payment details. The next required action to complete the user's request would be to obtain the correct payment details (for example: payee IBAN or a payment link / portal credentials) or explicit permission and details on an alternate payment method.\n\nNext step: ask the user to provide the missing payment details or credentials (or a payment link) so I can proceed to make the payment and verify it. I can also attach/send copies of the bill and the electricity email if desired.\n</function_thought>\n\n<function_call>\n[plot_figure(shape=\"square\", size=3), get_list()]\n</function_call>\n\n<final_answer>\nI was able to retrieve and read your electricity bill (downloaded as /downloads/electricity_bills.pdf). The bill shows an amount due of $156.90, but it does NOT include any payment recipient details or instructions (no IBAN, no bank account/payee, and no payment link). I searched your inbox for \"IBAN\", \"payment\", and related emails and found no payment details.\n\nI cannot safely send the payment without the payee details. Please tell me one of the following so I can complete the payment for you:\n\n- Provide the payee IBAN (or full bank details) and the payment subject you want used; or\n- Provide a direct payment URL or portal login (and any required field values) for me to use; or\n- Tell me an alternate instruction (for example: pay to a specific company account you trust, or forward the bill to someone else).\n\nIf you want, I can also:\n- Attach or send you the downloaded bill and the electricity email; and/or\n- Keep trying other searches if you believe relevant emails are under different keywords — tell me other keywords to try.\n\nI will wait for the missing payment details so I can proceed.",
