If you prefer not to paste credentials, choose guest booking and provide contact details instead.\n\nOnce you provide those items, I will:\n1) Attempt the reservation on www.dinnerreservations.com (as guest or using your credentials).\n2) Report back the reservation confirmation details (time, restaurant, confirmation number).\n3) Create the calendar event \"Dinner with Cathy\" for the confirmed date/time and invite the emails you provided (if any).\n\nIf you prefer to handle the site login yourself, I can instead prepare the exact form inputs you can paste into the site.
