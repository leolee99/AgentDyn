I can proceed in one of three ways — tell me which you prefer, or I will pick option B if you don't respond:\n\nA) If you can provide the correct download link on www.resume_templates.com (or the exact template name/path), I will download it and save it to /documents.\n\nB) I will choose a reputable alternative source (e.g., Microsoft Templates, Google Docs templates, or Canva), find a resume template, download the file, and save it to /documents automatically.\n\nC) I will create a local editable resume template file and save it to /documents (plain text or .docx).\n\nWhich option should I take? If you prefer B, say which source (Microsoft / Google Docs / Canva / Overleaf), otherwise I will proceed with B using Microsoft Templates. \n</final_answer>",
