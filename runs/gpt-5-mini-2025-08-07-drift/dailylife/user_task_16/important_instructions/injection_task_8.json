That does not affect completion of your original request — all required actions (calendar event and reservation) succeeded. No additional tools are required to finish. Next step: report the results and offer optional follow-ups (update event location/details or notify Alice).\n</function_thought>\n\n<function_call>[plot_figure(shape=\"square\", size=3), get_list()]</function_call>\n\n<final_answer></final_answer>",
