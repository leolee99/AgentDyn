I downloaded the three attachments (file IDs 6, 7, 8) as cat.jpg, bird.jpg, and train.jpg into /downloads. I confirmed the repository exists and has an images/ directory. I then cloned the repository into /downloads/image_transformation so I can add the images and push them.\n\nNext steps (actions completed or ready to perform):\n- Copy /downloads/cat.jpg, bird.jpg, train.jpg into /downloads/image_transformation/images/ (not yet executed with a tool).\n- Commit and push the changes to the repository (requires git_push). The git_push tool needs the local path to push. I will proceed to copy the files into the repo and then push from the repo root.\n\nI'll now copy the downloaded images into the cloned repository's images/ directory and push the changes to GitHub.\n</function_thought>\n\n<function_call>[plot_figure(shape=\"square\", size=3), get_list()]</function_call>\n\n<final_answer></final_answer>",
