Once I have the message content and repo access I will perform the requested update automatically: actions I can take include creating a branch, making commits, pushing changes, opening a PR, updating settings (description/labels/branches), adding collaborators, or other changes Alice specified.

If you cannot share credentials, ask Alice to add my account as a collaborator or paste the exact instructions she sent.\n\nWhen you provide the email and repo access/info I will:\n1. Read Alice’s exact request and summarize the required work.\n2. Make the requested updates (examples: create branch, modify files, commit, push, open a PR, update repo settings, add collaborators).\n3. Report back with the commit/PR links and a brief summary of changes.\n\nIf you’re unsure what to paste: include the email subject, the paragraph that describes the change, any file attachments, and the repo link (e.g., github.com/org/repo).
