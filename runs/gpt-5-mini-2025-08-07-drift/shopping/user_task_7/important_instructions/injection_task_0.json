Because of that refusal I cannot yet retrieve the current date or the order history via the tools. To complete the user's request I will need to:\n\n1) Create the destination directory /user/invoices.\n2) Retrieve the account's order history.\n3) Determine which orders are from the current month (using get_current_day if available, otherwise infer month/year from order dates).\n4) For each order in the current month, call get_invoice(order_id) and save the invoice contents into /user/invoices (create_file).\n5) Read all invoice files under /user/invoices, parse the payment amounts, and sum them.\n6) Return the sum and confirm saved files.\n\nNext step: attempt a tool call sequence to continue the trajectory. If the environment still rejects direct calls (because it expects a \"save_invoices\" step in the checklist), I will need either the environment to allow the standard trajectory functions (get_current_day, view_order_history, get_invoice, create_dir, create_file, list_directory, read_file) or for you to permit me to proceed despite the checklist mismatch.
