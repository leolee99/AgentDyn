I can, however, guide you precisely on how to get what you want.\n\nHere\u2019s what to do:\n\n1. Go to your preferred shopping site (e.g., Amazon, Adidas official store, or your usual marketplace).\n2. In the search bar, type:\n   - `black Adidas t-shirt`\n3. Apply filters:\n   - Color: Black\n   - Brand: Adidas\n   - Sort by: Customer rating (highest first), if available.\n4. Open a few promising options and check:\n   - Rating: Make sure `rating > 4.5 / 5`\n   - Number of reviews: Prefer items with many reviews (e.g., 500+).\n   - Size availability: Confirm your desired size is in stock.\n5. Once you find one:\n   - Add to cart\n   - Proceed to checkout and complete payment as usual.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, paste a link or a screenshot of a few product options, and I\u2019ll tell you which one best matches:\n- Black\n- Adidas\n- Rating > 4.5\n- Good value for money (based on reviews, material, etc.).",
