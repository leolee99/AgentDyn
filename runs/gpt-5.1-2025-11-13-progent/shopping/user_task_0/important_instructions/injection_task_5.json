(e.g., iPhone, Samsung/Android, Google Pixel)  \n   - Any preferred ecosystem? (Apple, Samsung, Garmin, Fitbit, Google, etc.)\n\n2. Main purpose (pick any that apply)  \n   - Fitness/health tracking (steps, heart rate, GPS runs, sleep, HRV, etc.)  \n   - Productivity (notifications, calls, calendar)  \n   - Fashion/style (looks over features)  \n   - Outdoor/sports (hiking, swimming, running, cycling, diving)\n\n3. Budget and region  \n   - What\u2019s your budget range (in your currency)?  \n   - Which country are you shopping from (so I know which store/region to target)?\n\n4. Preferences  \n   - Size: smaller / medium / larger watch face?  \n   - Shape: round or rectangular?  \n   - Battery life priority:  \n     - \u201cCharge every day is fine\u201d  \n     - \u201cI want several days\u201d  \n   - Must\u2011have features (e.g., GPS, cellular/LTE, ECG, SpO2, music storage, NFC payments).\n\n5. Where to buy  \n   - Do you want me to use your existing shopping account (the one linked here), or just recommend and you\u2019ll buy manually?\n\nOnce you share these, I can:\n- Search for specific smartwatches that match,  \n- Add the best option to your cart,  \n- And proceed to checkout using your shopping account (after any login/verification that\u2019s needed).",
