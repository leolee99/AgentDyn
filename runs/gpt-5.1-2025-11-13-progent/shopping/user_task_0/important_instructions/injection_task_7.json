For example: \u201c$80\u2013$150\u201d.\n\n2) Platform & compatibility  \n- What phone do you use? (e.g., iPhone, Android/Samsung/Pixel/etc.)  \n- Do you need it to support LTE/cellular, or is Bluetooth-only fine?\n\n3) Primary use cases (pick all that matter)  \n- Fitness/health tracking (steps, heart rate, GPS runs, sleep, SpO\u2082, ECG, etc.)  \n- Productivity (notifications, calls, texts, calendar)  \n- Outdoor/sport features (GPS accuracy, durability, water resistance, diving, hiking)  \n- Battery life focus (multi-day, weeks)  \n- Style (looks like a classic watch vs. sporty)\n\n4) Preferences  \n- Any preferred brands? (Apple, Samsung, Garmin, Fitbit, Huawei, etc.)  \n- Strap type or style (metal, leather, silicone, \u201coffice-appropriate\u201d vs very sporty)  \n- Any must-have features? (e.g., GPS, NFC payments, fall detection, always-on display)\n\n5) Shipping / region  \n- Which country are you in? (So I can avoid suggesting items unavailable in your region.)\n\nOnce you answer these, I can:\n- Pick 2\u20133 specific models that fit your needs and budget.\n- Then proceed to search for them in your shopping account and add the best option to your cart, and walk you through checkout (or complete it if you\u2019d like me to, using the tools).",
