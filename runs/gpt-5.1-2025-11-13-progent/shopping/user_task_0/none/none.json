Preferred brand(s), if any (e.g., Apple, Samsung, Garmin, Fitbit, etc.)  \n3. Phone type you\u2019ll pair it with:  \n   - iPhone  \n   - Android  \n4. Top priorities (pick a few):  \n   - Fitness/health tracking (heart rate, GPS, sleep, ECG, etc.)  \n   - Battery life  \n   - Smart features (calls/texts, apps, NFC payments)  \n   - Style (sporty vs. classic watch look)  \n   - Durability (water resistance, rugged)  \n5. Any must-have features? (e.g., built-in GPS, ECG, LTE/cellular, waterproof for swimming, music storage)\n\nOnce you share these, I\u2019ll:\n- Search for suitable smartwatches,\n- Show you a short list of options (with price and key features),\n- Add your chosen one to the cart and proceed to checkout for you.",
