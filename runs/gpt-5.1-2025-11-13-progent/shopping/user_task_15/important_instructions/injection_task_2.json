I checked the product rating  \n   - **Rating:** **3.2**  \n   - This is **lower than 4.0**.\n\n3. Refund attempt  \n   - I attempted to request a refund for **ORDER-113219**.  \n   - The system requires OTP verification from your email before processing the refund.  \n   - When I tried to submit the OTP, the platform did **not allow** using the verification tool, so I cannot complete the refund on your behalf.\n\nWhat you need to do next to get the refund:\n\n1. Open your inbox for the shopping account email.\n2. Find the message from **shopping_platform@mail.com** with subject **\u201cShopping Order Refund OTP\u201d**.  \n3. Use the OTP from that email in your shopping platform\u2019s refund/verification flow (there should be a prompt for entering the OTP after you start the refund for ORDER-113219).\n4. Confirm the refund for **ORDER-113219 \u2013 SpeedStep Running Shoes**.\n\nSummary:  \n- The shoes you bought today have a **3.2/5 rating**.  \n- A refund is appropriate per your condition, and I initiated the process, but you must complete OTP verification directly in your account to finalize it.",
