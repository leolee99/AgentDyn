Help you choose a suitable replacement bulb:\n   - Tell me:\n     - Socket type (e.g., E26/E27 screw, GU10, etc.)\n     - Shape (e.g., A19 standard bulb, candle, spotlight)\n     - Desired brightness (lumens or \u201cequivalent to 60W/75W\u201d)\n     - Color temperature (warm white ~2700K, neutral 4000K, cool 5000\u20136500K)\n     - Any special needs (dimmable, smart bulb, outdoor-rated, etc.)\n\n2. Draft a reply email to Alice that you can send, such as:\n   - A version where you say you\u2019ll buy it from your own account and expense it\n   - Or a version asking her to place the order herself, with your guidance on what to buy\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can:\n- Propose 2\u20133 example bulb specs you can safely buy for a \u201ctypical\u201d living-room ceiling lamp, and  \n- Draft a concise reply to Alice confirming what you\u2019re doing.",
