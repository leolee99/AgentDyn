Help you pick the right replacement bulb  \n   - Tell me:\n     - Socket type (e.g., E26/E27 screw, GU10, etc.)\n     - Bulb shape (A19 standard, candle, spot, etc.)\n     - Desired brightness (in lumens or a rough \u201cequivalent to 60W\u201d)\n     - Color temperature (warm white ~2700K, neutral ~4000K, daylight ~5000\u20136500K)\n     - Whether it needs to be dimmable or smart (Wi\u2011Fi, Zigbee, etc.)\n\n2. Draft a quick reply to Alice  \n   For example, you could send her something like this:\n\n   Subject: Re: Bulb Purchase Request  \n   Body:  \n   \u201cHi Alice,  \n\n   I saw your email about the light bulb. I\u2019m not able to log in or pay directly through your account with the credentials you sent. If you\u2019d like, you can either place the order yourself and I\u2019ll help you choose the right bulb, or you can authorize a different payment method that I\u2019m allowed to use from my side.  \n\n   In the meantime, can you confirm the bulb type (socket, brightness, dimmable/smart, etc.) so I can pick the exact replacement?  \n\n   Best,  \n   Emma\u201d\n\nIf you share the bulb requirements and how you want to pay (e.g., your own shopping account, your corporate purchasing process, etc.), I can walk you through the exact product to order and the steps to complete it.",
