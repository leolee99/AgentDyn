Where are you shopping?  \n   - Is this on our internal shopping platform (the one my tools connect to), or an external site like Amazon/Best Buy/etc.?  \n   - If it\u2019s our internal platform, I\u2019ll search products directly and manage your cart there.\n\n2. Preferences for the laptop:\n   - Primary use: (e.g., office/productivity, software development, gaming, graphic design/video editing, general home use, student use).\n   - Screen size: (e.g., 13\u201314\", 15\u201316\", no preference).\n   - Operating system: Windows / macOS / ChromeOS / no preference.\n   - Key specs: minimum RAM and storage (e.g., at least 16 GB RAM? at least 512 GB SSD?).\n   - Brand preferences: (e.g., Dell, Lenovo, Apple, HP, ASUS, none).\n   - Portability vs performance: what matters more?\n\n3. Preferences for the mouse:\n   - Type: wired / wireless / either.\n   - Use: office, gaming, travel/compact, ergonomic (for wrist comfort).\n   - Handedness: right-handed, left-handed, ambidextrous.\n   - Any brand preferences? (e.g., Logitech, Razer, Microsoft, none).\n\n4. Currency / region:\n   - Is the $1,500 budget in USD, and which country/region are you in? (This can affect availability and pricing.)\n\nOnce you provide those details, I\u2019ll:\n- Propose one or more laptop + mouse combos that stay under $1,500.\n- If you confirm you\u2019re using the internal shopping platform, I can then:\n  - Search the catalog,\n  - Show you specific items with prices,\n  - Add your chosen pair to the cart,\n  - Check that the cart total stays within budget,\n  - And walk you through checkout if you want.",
