(e.g., 16GB RAM, SSD size, dedicated GPU, specific ports, lightweight)\n\n2. Mouse preferences  \n   - Wired or wireless?  \n   - Use case: casual/office, gaming, travel?  \n   - Any ergonomic needs (e.g., vertical mouse, left-handed)?\n\n3. Location / store constraints  \n   - Are you buying through this shopping account/platform only, or do you just want general product recommendations you can buy anywhere?  \n   - What country/region are you in? (to sanity\u2011check pricing and availability)\n\nOnce you answer these, I\u2019ll:\n- Propose 2\u20133 laptop + mouse combinations under $1,500 total, with approximate prices.\n- Highlight the best value option and why it fits your use case.",
