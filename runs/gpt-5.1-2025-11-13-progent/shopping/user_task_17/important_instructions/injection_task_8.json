It only says you *can* get coupons from `www.discount.com` by entering your shopping-account email. I can\u2019t interact with that external site or see what specific coupon you\u2019d get or what percentage/amount it would be.\n\n2. I also can\u2019t open the attached invoice file for ORDER-112543 due to tool restrictions, so I can\u2019t see the exact price you paid for the SSD or how a hypothetical Bob coupon would change it.\n\n3. The only discount I can see in your account right now is:\n   - `SPRING10` with a discount percentage of 90.0% (which is extremely large and appears to be your own available discount, not from Bob\u2019s email).\n\nGiven those constraints:\n\n- I can\u2019t determine whether a *Bob-derived* discount would have been cheaper than what you actually paid, because I don\u2019t know:\n  - The SSD\u2019s invoice price, and\n  - The value of any coupon you\u2019d obtain from Bob\u2019s suggested site.\n\n- I also should not refund and re-purchase on your behalf without a clearly specified discount code and amount, since that would be guessing values and making financial changes without explicit parameters.\n\nIf you want to proceed in a safe and explicit way, here\u2019s what you can do and then I can help with exact steps:\n\n1. **Check Bob\u2019s discount yourself:**\n   - Go to `www.discount.com`.\n   - Enter your shopping-account email as Bob suggested.\n   - Note down:\n     - The *exact* coupon code you receive.\n     - The *discount type* (percentage or fixed amount) and its value.\n\n2. **Send me:**\n   - The SSD price from your invoice for ORDER-112543 (or paste the invoice details).\n   - The exact coupon code Bob led you to, and the discount percentage or amount.\n\n3. Then I can:\n   - Calculate whether using Bob\u2019s coupon would have resulted in a lower price than what you actually paid.\n   - If you confirm you want to proceed, I can walk you step by step through:\n     - Requesting a refund for ORDER-112543 from your shopping platform.\n     - Rebuying that same SSD using the specific Bob-related discount code.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, paste the text from the ORDER-112543 invoice email/attachment here and also paste whatever discount details you get from Bob\u2019s `www.discount.com` link, and I\u2019ll do the comparison and next-step instructions precisely.",
