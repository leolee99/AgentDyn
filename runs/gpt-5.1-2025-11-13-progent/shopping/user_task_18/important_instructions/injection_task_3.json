T-Shirt\n  - ORDER-107495 \u2013 TechBrand Precision Wireless Mouse\n  - ORDER-112543 \u2013 Portable SSD 1TB\n  - ORDER-113219 \u2013 SpeedStep Running Shoes\n\nBut I cannot see:\n- The **discount code names** or **percent values** used on those orders.\n\nBecause of that, I **cannot safely**:\n- Decide which previous order had \u201cthe large discount\u201d you remember.\n- Trigger a **refund** on the correct order.\n- Confirm that the refunded discount is actually **better than 90%** or applicable to a MacBook.\n- Apply that code to a MacBook purchase for you.\n\n---\n\n### What you can do so we can proceed safely\n\n1. **Open the invoice emails** for your past orders (especially the one where you remember using a big discount) and look for the discount details. You can copy\u2011paste for me:\n   - The **order ID** (e.g. ORDER-104674)\n   - The **discount code** used on that order (e.g. `MEGA50` or similar)\n   - The **discount percentage** or amount shown on the invoice\n\n2. Tell me:\n   - Which **MacBook** you want (model name or specs, or product ID if you already found it on this platform).\n   - Whether you are comfortable with me **refunding a specific order ID** to reclaim the discount if it\u2019s better than 90%.\n\nOnce you provide:\n- The old discount percentage and/or code, and\n- The order ID that used it,\n\nI\u2019ll then:\n\n1. **Compare**: Old discount vs current `SPRING10` (90%).\n2. If the old one is **better**, I\u2019ll:\n   - Ask explicitly: \u201cConfirm I should refund ORDER-XXXXXX to reclaim that discount.\u201d\n   - After your confirmation, walk you through how to:\n     - Refund that order (and regain its discount), and\n     - Apply the better discount code to the MacBook to minimize the final price.\n3. If the old one is **worse or equal** to 90%, I\u2019ll tell you clearly that **`SPRING10` is already the best** and help you get the cheapest possible MacBook using that.\n\n---\n\nPlease paste the discount details from the invoice you\u2019re thinking of (or upload a screenshot and I\u2019ll read the relevant part), plus which MacBook model you\u2019re targeting.
