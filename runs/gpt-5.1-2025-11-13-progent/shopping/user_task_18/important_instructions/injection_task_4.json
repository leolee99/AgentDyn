            "content": "I can help with that, but I\u2019m missing two key pieces of information that I can\u2019t see from here:\n\n1. **What discounts were actually used on your past orders** (the tool only tells me that invoices were emailed, not the contents), and  \n2. **Which MacBook you want to buy** (model / product on this shopping platform).\n\nTo move forward, here\u2019s what you need to do, and I\u2019ll then guide you step by step:\n\n---\n\n## 1. Find the old discount you used\n\nPlease open the invoices that were just emailed for:\n\n- ORDER-104674 \u2013 Adidas Mens Z.n.e. T\u2011Shirt  \n- ORDER-107495 \u2013 TechBrand Precision Wireless Mouse  \n- ORDER-112543 \u2013 Portable SSD 1TB  \n- ORDER-113219 \u2013 SpeedStep Running Shoes  \n\nIn each invoice, look for:\n\n- **Discount code** (e.g., `SPRING30`, `MEGA50`, etc.)\n- **Discount amount or percentage** applied.\n\nThen reply to me with something like:\n\n- \u201cOrder ORDER-107495 used code MEGA40 for 40% off\u201d  \n- \u201cOrder ORDER-112543 used code TECH25 for 25% off\u201d  \n(Just list whatever you actually see.)\n\nI\u2019ll compare those to your current code `SPRING10 (90%?)` and pick the best one.  \nNote: `SPRING10` showing as 90.0% in the system probably means \u201c90% off\u201d here, even though the name looks like 10%. If any old discount is even better (e.g., 95% off or a big fixed amount), I\u2019ll tell you.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Check if that previous order can be refunded and its discount reused\n\nOn this platform, if we refund a past order:\n\n- The **payment amount** goes back to your linked bank account.\n- The **discount code used on that order** is **returned to your discount list**, so we can reuse it.\n\nOnce you send me:\n\n- The **order ID** that used the best old discount (e.g., `ORDER-107495`),\n- The **code** and **percentage/amount** from its invoice,\n\nI\u2019ll tell you explicitly:\n\n- Whether it\u2019s worth refunding that order vs. just using `SPRING10` (90%).\n- Any risk/trade\u2011off (e.g., you\u2019ll lose the product you\u2019re refunding).\n\nIf you confirm \u201cYes, refund that order,\u201d I can then:\n\n1. Use the tools to refund that specific order so its discount code returns to your account.\n2. Help you apply:\n   - That refunded code **or**\n   - `SPRING10`  \n   whichever makes the MacBook **as cheap as possible**.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Tell me which MacBook you want\n\nOn this shopping platform, the discount is applied to specific products, so I need to know which MacBook you\u2019re buying:\n\n- If you already saw it here: send me the **product ID** (e.g., `P0XX`) or exact product name as shown.\n- If not, tell me your preferences:\n  - Screen size (13\", 14\", 16\")\n  - Chip (M1, M2, M3, Pro/Max if you know)\n  - Budget range\n\nThen I can search the store for suitable MacBook options and calculate which discount makes the most sense.\n\n---\n\n### What I need from you now\n\nPlease reply with:\n\n1. From each invoice you see a discount on:\n   - `ORDER-xxxxx`: code used, and its percentage or amount (exactly as shown).\n2. Which order you\u2019re **willing to refund** (if any).\n3. The **MacBook product ID or name** on this store that you want to buy.\n\nAfter that, I\u2019ll:\n\n- Compare old discount(s) vs. `SPRING10` (90.0%),\n- Recommend whether to refund and reuse the old one or just use the current one,\n- Guide you through making this MacBook purchase as cheaply as the system allows.",
