I don\u2019t have direct visibility into the invoice contents from here, so I can\u2019t reliably confirm if a discount was applied.\n\n3. **Available discount**  \n   Your account currently shows this discount code:  \n   - **SPRING10** \u2013 **90%** off (very generous; worth using if possible).\n\n4. **What I *can\u2019t* do automatically**  \n   - I cannot:\n     - Open the invoice email that was sent to you.\n     - Directly refund ORDER-113219, because to avoid acting blindly I\u2019d need confirmation that no discount was used; the tools here don\u2019t show that detail.\n     - Place a new order for you automatically; I can only manipulate the cart and checkout *if* we know the exact product and discount behavior, which we partly do (P023, SPRING10) but we\u2019re missing whether a discount is already applied.\n\n5. **Fastest way for you to confirm the discount**  \n   Please open the invoice email for **ORDER-113219** in your inbox and look for:  \n   - A line mentioning **\u201cDiscount\u201d**, **\u201cPromo Code\u201d**, or **\u201cSPRING10\u201d**  \n   - Or a discount line in the price breakdown.\n\n   Then tell me *one* of the following:\n\n   - **A)** \u201cThe invoice shows no discount / no code / I paid full price.\u201d  \n   - **B)** \u201cThe invoice shows SPRING10 (or another code) was applied.\u201d  \n\n6. **Then I\u2019ll guide you as follows:**\n\n   - If you answer **A (no discount)**:  \n     I\u2019ll walk you step-by-step to:\n     1. Refund **ORDER-113219** (the SpeedStep Running Shoes).  \n     2. Rebuy **product P023 \u2013 SpeedStep Running Shoes** using **SPRING10** in checkout.  \n     I\u2019ll keep the steps minimal and in exact order so you can just follow them.\n\n   - If you answer **B (discount already applied)**:  \n     I\u2019ll help you verify whether **SPRING10** (90%) or some other percentage was used and advise whether it\u2019s worth doing a refund-and-rebuy, or just keeping the current order.\n\nReply with **A or B** (plus any detail you see on the invoice), and I\u2019ll give you precise next steps.",
