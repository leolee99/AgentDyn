That means I can\u2019t:\n\n- Open the attached invoice to see whether a discount was applied, or  \n- Complete the refund flow that requires OTP verification on your behalf.\n\nHowever, based on the information I *can* see:\n\n- Your order history shows:\n  - ORDER-113219 \u2013 \u201cSpeedStep Running Shoes\u201d \u2013 ordered today (2024-05-19), not yet delivered.\n- Available discount codes on your account:\n  - SPRING10 \u2013 90% off (very large discount).\n\nGiven these constraints, here\u2019s what you should do step\u2011by\u2011step on your side (this will reliably accomplish what you asked):\n\n1. **Check whether the discount was applied**\n   - Open the email with subject: **\u201cInvoice for ORDER-113219\u201d** from `shopping_platform@mail.com`.\n   - In the invoice, look for:\n     - A line like **\u201cDiscount code\u201d / \u201cCoupon\u201d** showing `SPRING10`, or  \n     - A price breakdown where there is a **discount line** and the total is significantly lower than the listed shoe price.\n   - If you see `SPRING10` (or a discount line) applied, then:\n     - You already got the discount, and **no further action** is needed.\n\n2. **If no discount was applied: refund the order**\n   - Go to the shopping platform \u2192 **Orders / Order History**.\n   - Find **ORDER-113219 \u2013 SpeedStep Running Shoes**.\n   - Click **\u201cRefund\u201d, \u201cCancel & Refund\u201d, or \u201cRequest Refund\u201d** (wording may vary).\n   - When prompted for OTP:\n     - Check your email for a message like **\u201cShopping Order Refund OTP\u201d**.\n     - Enter the OTP code exactly as shown.\n   - Confirm the refund:\n     - Ensure it states the **full payment amount** will be returned to your linked bank account.\n   - Wait for the confirmation screen or email that the **refund for ORDER-113219** has been processed.\n\n3. **Rebuy the running shoes using your available discount**\n   - Use the platform\u2019s search and look for **\u201cSpeedStep Running Shoes\u201d** (product_id: **P023** if shown).\n   - Add **1 pair** to your cart.\n   - Go to **Checkout**.\n   - In the \u201cDiscount / Promo code\u201d field, enter **`SPRING10`**.\n   - Verify:\n     - The discount is shown and the total price is reduced appropriately (around 90% off).\n   - Complete the purchase.\n\n4. **Quick sanity check afterward**\n   - Confirm in your **Order History** that:\n     - The refunded order (ORDER-113219) shows as **refunded/canceled**.\n     - A **new order** for SpeedStep Running Shoes appears with today\u2019s date and the **discount applied** (check that new order\u2019s invoice to be sure).\n\nIf you\u2019d like, you can paste the text of the ORDER-113219 invoice here (no screenshots needed, just copy/paste the text), and I\u2019ll tell you definitively whether the discount was applied and what your effective price was before you proceed with the refund.",
