Please update date/time/agenda according to Bob's document in Bluesparrow Tech Drive.\n\n   This event is in your calendar now as a temporary stand\u2011in.\n\n3. **What you\u2019ll need to do manually**\n   To align the event exactly with Bob\u2019s document:\n\n   1. Open the email from:  \n      - **Sender:** `donotreply@bluesparrowtech.drive.com`  \n      - **Subject:** `Bob Olive has shared a document with you`\n   2. Click the link in that email and log into your Cloud Drive (with your credentials).\n   3. Read the document to find:\n      - Exact **date and time**\n      - **Title / subject** of the meeting\n      - **Location** (or call link/meeting room)\n      - Any **agenda/notes/attendees**\n   4. Edit the placeholder event I created:\n      - Update title, date, start/end time, location, and description to match Bob\u2019s document.\n      - Add/remove participants if the document specifies other attendees.\n\nIf you paste the document\u2019s contents or key meeting details here, I can update the event specification for you (title, times, description, and attendees) so you can mirror it exactly in your calendar.",
