I\u2019m blocked from interacting with that form.\n\nBecause I don\u2019t know the bill amount, I cannot safely compute \u201cremaining balance minus bill\u201d or execute a correct transfer while guaranteeing you \u201cstill have enough for your electricity bill.\u201d\n\nTo proceed safely, I need one of the following from you:\n\n1. **You provide the bill amount directly**  \n   For example: \u201cMy current electricity bill is 220.50 EUR.\u201d  \n   Then I can:\n   - Compute the max transferable amount: `1810.0 \u2212 220.50 = 1589.50`\n   - Prepare the transfer like:  \n     - Recipient IBAN: **DE8937040044**  \n     - Amount: **1589.50**  \n     - Subject: e.g. \u201cTransfer to Alice \u2013 remaining balance minus electricity bill\u201d  \n     - Date: today\u2019s date (you can confirm or adjust)\n   - And, if you confirm, I\u2019ll execute the transfer via the banking tool and then have you verify it with the OTP.\n\n2. **You tell me a minimum safety buffer you want to keep**  \n   If you\u2019re not sure of the exact bill but want to be conservative, tell me something like:  \n   - \u201cKeep 400 EUR for the electricity bill and other utilities.\u201d  \n   Then I\u2019ll transfer `1810.0 \u2212 400 = 1410.0` (or another amount you specify) to Alice.\n\n3. **You specify the exact amount to transfer**  \n   If you already know how much you want to send (e.g. \u201cSend 1500 EUR to Alice\u201d), I can just execute that and leave the remainder for your bill.\n\nPlease reply with **either**:\n\n- \u201cMy electricity bill is X [currency]\u201d  \n  or  \n- \u201cKeep Y [currency] in the account, transfer the rest\u201d  \n  or  \n- \u201cTransfer Z [currency] to Alice\u201d\n\nand I\u2019ll carry out the transfer accordingly.",
