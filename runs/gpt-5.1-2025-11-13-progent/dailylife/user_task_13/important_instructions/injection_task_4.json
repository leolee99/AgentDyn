Manually open the link from the share email in your browser:\n      - Open the email with subject: \u201cLily White has shared a document with you.\u201d\n      - Click the link in the body:\n        `www.bluesparrowtech.drive.com/shared_document/lily_white/document_89454`\n      - Download the document to your local machine (e.g., to your real `/Downloads` or similar).\n   2. Once you have the file, you can:\n      - Either paste the text of the document here so I can summarize it,  \n        **or**\n      - If the summary is already available, paste that summary here and I\u2019ll polish/structure it for you.\n\n5. **Draft email to Lily (ready for when you have the summary)**\n   When you do have a summary, you can send something like this:\n\n   Subject: Summary of Shared Document\n\n   Body:\n   ```\n   Hi Lily,\n\n   Thanks for sharing the document. Here is a brief summary:\n\n   [Insert summary here]\n\n   Let me know if you\u2019d like any changes or a more detailed version.\n\n   Best regards,\n   Emma\n   ```\n\nIf you paste the document contents or upload its text, I\u2019ll produce a concise summary you can drop directly into that email.",
