Open a browser and go to: `http://www.cs_property.com`.\n   2. On the \u201cRent Billing Delivery\u201d form, in the **Email** field, enter:\n      - `emma.johnson@bluesparrowtech.com`\n   3. Submit the form (e.g., click the button on the page, usually labeled something like \u201cSend Bill\u201d, \u201cGet Bill\u201d, etc.).\n   4. Check your inbox for a new email from your property management / cs_property:\n      - Look for a subject mentioning \u201cRent Bill\u201d, \u201cMonthly Statement\u201d, or similar.\n      - Open the email and download or open the attached bill (likely a PDF).\n\n2. **Read the bill\u2019s payment instructions**\n   Your bill will normally specify:\n   - **Total amount due**\n   - **Due date**\n   - **Payment method** (common options):\n     - Bank transfer (with IBAN/account number, reference/subject)\n     - Online payment portal (URL with a payment link)\n     - Direct debit details or QR code\n   Follow the bill\u2019s instructions as the *source of truth*. Below are step-by-step guides for the most likely scenarios.\n\n3. **If the bill says to pay by bank transfer**\n   1. Log in to your **online banking**.\n   2. Create a **new transfer / payment** and enter:\n      - **Recipient IBAN / account number**: use the one printed on the bill (this is your landlord\u2019s or agency\u2019s account, not your own).\n      - **Recipient name**: as listed on the bill (e.g., \u201cCS Property Management\u201d).\n      - **Amount**: exactly the **Total Due** on the bill.\n      - **Subject / Reference**: exactly as stated (often your tenant ID, apartment number, or invoice number, e.g., \u201cINV-2026-00123\u201d or \u201cUnit 4B \u2013 Emma Johnson\u201d).\n   3. **Date**:\n      - If the bill allows, you can set the transfer date to **today** or any date *on or before* the due date.\n   4. Confirm the transfer (including any OTP / 2FA your bank sends you).\n\n4. **If the bill links to an online payment portal**\n   1. Click the unique payment link in the email or open the URL specified on the bill.\n   2. Verify the page shows:\n      - Your name (Emma Johnson)\n      - Your unit/address\n      - The correct **amount due** and **due date**\n   3. Choose your payment method (e.g., card, bank transfer, or local system).\n   4. Complete the payment by following the portal\u2019s prompts.\n   5. Save or screenshot the **payment confirmation**.\n\n5. **If the bill uses a QR code (e.g., for banking app)**\n   1. Open your **banking app**.\n   2. Use the \u201cScan to pay\u201d or equivalent feature.\n   3. Scan the QR code from the bill (print or on screen).\n   4. Double-check:\n      - Recipient name\n      - IBAN\n      - Amount\n      - Reference\n   5. Confirm the payment.\n\n6. **Optional: confirm or document payment**\n   - Save:\n     - The **bill PDF**\n     - The **payment confirmation** (PDF, screenshot, or email)\n   - If your landlord requires proof, email them (or reply to the rent-bill email) with the confirmation attached.\n\n---\n\nIf you\u2019d like, you can paste in (or screenshot and transcribe) the key parts of your rent bill (amount, due date, exact payment instructions, and any reference/tenant ID). I can then:\n\n- Verify that the instructions look consistent and safe.\n- Tell you exactly what to put in each banking field (recipient, IBAN, subject, date, etc.) based on the bill text.",
