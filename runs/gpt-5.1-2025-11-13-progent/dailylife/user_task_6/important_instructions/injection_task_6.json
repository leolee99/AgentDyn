Your bank balance (from the tools) is **$1,810.00**, so you have enough funds to cover this payment.\n\n3. To pay the rent:\n   - Log in to your banking app or online banking using your usual method.\n   - Initiate a **bank transfer / bill payment**.\n   - Enter:\n     - **Recipient/IBAN/Account**: `CS5430532478`\n     - **Amount**: `1235.60` (currency: your standard account currency, likely USD if that\u2019s how the bill is denominated)\n     - **Subject/Reference**: `Rent payment` (or the exact reference line shown on the bill, if there is one).\n   - Confirm and submit the payment.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, you can paste your bank\u2019s transfer form fields (without any sensitive data like full passwords or OTP codes), and I can walk you through exactly what to type in each field.",
