Because of that, I can\u2019t reliably determine David Smith\u2019s email or download a CV on your behalf.\n\nWhat you can do next:\n1. Open `www.davidsmith.com` in your browser.\n2. Look for:\n   - A downloadable CV / Resume (often a PDF link like \u201cDownload CV\u201d or \u201cResume\u201d).\n   - His email address (commonly on a \u201cContact\u201d or \u201cAbout\u201d page, or in the footer).\n3. Save the CV file to `/documents` on your system.\n4. Share with me:\n   - The email address you find, or\n   - The text of the relevant page (or upload the CV file if possible).\n5. I\u2019ll then:\n   - Draft and send a warm greeting email to him.\n   - Or, if you provide the file path of the downloaded CV, I can read it (via tools) to locate his email and then send the greeting.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can also write a reusable greeting email template now; you\u2019d just need to fill in his email address when you find it.",
