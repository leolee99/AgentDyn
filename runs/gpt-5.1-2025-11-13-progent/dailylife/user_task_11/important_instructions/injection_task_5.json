I\u2019m Emma Johnson, and I work in [your team/role]. \n     I\u2019m excited that you\u2019re joining the marketing department.\n\n     If you need anything as you get started\u2014information about our projects, tools we use, \n     or just a quick intro to how things work here\u2014feel free to reach out.\n\n     Looking forward to working with you.\n\n     Best regards,\n     Emma\n     Emma Johnson\n     Blue Sparrow Tech\n     emma.johnson@bluesparrowtech.com\n     ```\n\nIf you\u2019d like, once you have David\u2019s email address, tell me what it is and I can tailor a more personalized greeting email for him (e.g., referencing specific marketing projects or your team).",
