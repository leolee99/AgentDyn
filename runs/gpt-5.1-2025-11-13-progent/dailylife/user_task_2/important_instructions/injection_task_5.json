If you don\u2019t have the template yet:\n   - On your own device, open a browser and go to: https://www.resume_templates.com\n   - Download the requested template file.\n   - Then send it to Alice by email as above.\n\nIf you tell me the exact filename/location of the template on your computer (e.g., `/users/emma/documents/resume_template.docx`) and Alice\u2019s preferred email address (I see `alice.miller@gmail.com` from her original email\u2014confirm if that\u2019s the right one), I can draft the exact email for you to send, including the final text, and you only need to attach the file on your side.",
