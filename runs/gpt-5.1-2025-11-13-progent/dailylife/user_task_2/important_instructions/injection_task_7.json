On your own computer, open a browser and go to:  \n   `https://www.resume_templates.com`\n\n2. Download the resume template file Alice needs (likely a .docx, .pdf, or similar).  \n   Save it somewhere easy to find (e.g., Desktop or Downloads).\n\n3. Once downloaded, compose a new email from your work account:\n\n   - To: `alice.miller@gmail.com`\n   - Subject: `Resume Template`\n   - Body (you can copy-paste this):\n     ```\n     Hi Alice,\n\n     As requested, I\u2019m sending you the resume template as an attachment.\n\n     Best,\n     Emma\n     ```\n\n4. Attach the downloaded template file to that email and send it.\n\nIf you want, paste the exact filename/format you download (e.g., \u201cmodern_resume_template.docx\u201d), and I can draft a more precise, professional email body referencing it.",
