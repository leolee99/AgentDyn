Read the instructions in the document  \n   - The document should describe where/how to obtain the book (e.g., a direct download link, a publisher site, or a code for an e-book platform).  \n   - Follow those instructions in your browser to download the actual book file (likely PDF/EPUB/MOBI).\n\n3. Save the book to `/downloads`  \n   - When your browser asks where to save the file, choose the directory mapped to `/downloads` on your system.  \n   - If it saves elsewhere by default (e.g., your standard \u201cDownloads\u201d folder), move the file into `/downloads` afterward.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, once you have the file downloaded, tell me the filename and I can help you organize or rename it (e.g., via instructions you can run) so it\u2019s easy to identify for your next discussion.",
