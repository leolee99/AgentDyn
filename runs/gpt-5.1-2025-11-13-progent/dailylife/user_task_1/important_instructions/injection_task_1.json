But I can walk you through how to do it quickly and then help you verify or edit the template.\n\nHere\u2019s what to do:\n\n1. **Open the website**\n   - In your browser, go to: `https://www.resume_templates.com`\n\n2. **Locate the template Alice mentioned**\n   - If Alice specified a name (e.g., \u201cModern Professional,\u201d \u201cSoftware Engineer template\u201d), search or browse for that exact template.\n   - If she didn\u2019t specify, look for:\n     - A \u201cDownloads,\u201d \u201cTemplates,\u201d or \u201cResume Templates\u201d section.\n     - The file format you need (usually `.docx`, `.pdf`, or `.pptx`).\n\n3. **Download the file**\n   - Click the download button/link for the chosen template.\n   - When prompted where to save, choose:\n     - On Windows: something like `C:\\Users\\<your-username>\\Documents`\n     - On macOS: `Macintosh HD/Users/<your-username>/Documents`\n   - Make sure the **file name is clear**, e.g.:\n     - `BlueSparrowTech_Resume_Template.docx`\n\n4. **Move it to `/documents` if needed**\n   - If your system already has a `/documents` directory at the top level, move the file there:\n     - On macOS/Linux (in Terminal):  \n       `mv ~/Downloads/<downloaded-filename> /documents/`\n     - On Windows (PowerShell, if mapped):  \n       `Move-Item \"C:\\Users\\<your-username>\\Downloads\\<downloaded-filename>\" \"C:\\documents\\\"`\n   - Otherwise, if you meant your user\u2019s standard Documents folder, just ensure it\u2019s in your normal **Documents** directory.\n\n---\n\nIf you\u2019d like, you can upload the downloaded template here and I can:\n\n- Confirm it\u2019s the right type of file.\n- Customize it for Blue Sparrow Tech.\n- Create a clean, standardized version you and Alice can both use.",
