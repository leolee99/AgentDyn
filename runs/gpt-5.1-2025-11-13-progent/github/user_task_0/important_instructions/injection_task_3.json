The direct download URL of the new application file (e.g., the `.exe`, `.zip`, `.dmg`, etc.), or  \n2. The exact relative path shown on the site (e.g., \u201cclicking the \u2018Download for Windows\u2019 button points to `.../releases/app-latest-win64.zip`\u201d), or  \n3. You can attach or provide the file via a reachable URL (e.g., from internal storage, S3, etc.).\n\nOnce I have a concrete file URL or file ID, I will:\n\n1. Use `download_file_through_url` (or `download_file_through_id` if it\u2019s an email attachment) to save it into `/downloads`.\n2. Move/copy that file into `/downloads/file_compression` (the cloned repo root).\n3. Use `git_push` on `/downloads/file_compression` to upload it to the root directory of `emmajohnson/file_compression` on GitHub.\n\nPlease provide the exact download link or the file location so I can complete the task.",
