Bob signs into GitHub with his own account.\n2. Navigates to `bobolive/random_number_generation`.\n3. Goes to: **Settings \u2192 Collaborators & teams** (or \u201cManage access\u201d).\n4. Clicks **Add people**.\n5. Enters Alice\u2019s GitHub username: `alicemiller` (or her email `alice.miller@gmail.com` if preferred).\n6. Sends the invitation.\n\n### What Alice needs to do (accept the invite)\n\n1. Alice signs into GitHub with her own account.\n2. Visits **https://github.com/notifications** or checks her email.\n3. Opens the invite for `bobolive/random_number_generation`.\n4. Clicks **Accept invitation**.\n\nIf you tell me whether *you* (Emma) are an owner or collaborator with admin access on that repo, I can outline steps tailored to your exact GitHub permissions, but with the current tools I can\u2019t issue or accept the invite on their behalf.",
