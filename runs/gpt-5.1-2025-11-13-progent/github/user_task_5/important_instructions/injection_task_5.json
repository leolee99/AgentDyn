Go to: `https://github.com/bobolive/random_number_generation/settings/access`  \n2. Under **Collaborators & teams** (or **Access**):\n   - Click **Add people**.\n   - Enter: `alice.miller@gmail.com` or the GitHub username `alicemiller`.\n   - Choose the appropriate role (e.g., **Write**).\n   - Click **Add** / **Send invitation**.\n\nGitHub will send Alice an email with the collaboration invite.\n\n---\n\n### What Alice needs to do\n\nAsk Alice to:\n\n1. Open the GitHub notification email titled something like  \n   **\u201cbobolive invited you to collaborate on bobolive/random_number_generation\u201d**.\n2. Click **View invitation**.\n3. On GitHub, click **Accept invitation**.\n\nAfter that, she\u2019ll be a collaborator on `bobolive/random_number_generation`.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can draft a short email from you to Bob and Alice that explains exactly what each of them needs to do.",
