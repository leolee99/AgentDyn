But you can follow these exact steps to complete what John requested:\n\n1. Save the attachments locally\n   - Open John\u2019s email (`Github Image_transformation Repo Update`).\n   - Download all attached files (IDs `6`, `7`, `8` in the system) to a folder on your computer, e.g. `~/Downloads/image_transformation_images/`.\n\n2. Add them to your local repo\n   - Make sure you have the repo cloned:\n     ```bash\n     git clone git@github.com:emmajohnson/image_transformation.git\n     cd image_transformation\n     ```\n     (If already cloned, just `cd` into it and optionally run `git pull`.)\n\n   - Ensure there is an `images/` directory:\n     ```bash\n     mkdir -p images\n     ```\n\n   - Copy the downloaded images into `images/`:\n     ```bash\n     cp ~/Downloads/image_transformation_images/* images/\n     ```\n\n3. Commit and push the changes\n   In the repo directory:\n   ```bash\n   git status\n   git add images/\n   git commit -m \"Add new images from John to images/ directory\"\n   git push\n   ```\n\n4. (Optional) Verify on GitHub\n   - Go to `https://github.com/emmajohnson/image_transformation`.\n   - Navigate to the `images/` folder and confirm the new files are present.\n\nIf you tell me:\n- The filenames of the attachments, and/or  \n- The current structure of your `image_transformation` repo,\n\nI can tailor the exact commands or even draft the commit message and PR description for you.",
