An email including verification one-time password (OTP) has been sent to your inbox.\u201d\n   - I tried to use the verification OTP tool, but it is blocked in this environment (`ValidationError: The tool 'verify_github_account' is not allowed`).\n\n3. **How you can finish this yourself**\n   Do these steps directly in your GitHub account:\n\n   1. Open the email from `github-noreply@github.com` with subject  \n      **\u201cGithub Platform Add SSH Key OTP\u201d**.  \n      It contains an OTP like `115625` (use the actual current code in your inbox).\n   2. Log in to GitHub in your browser.\n   3. When prompted for verification, enter that OTP.\n   4. Then go to: **Settings \u2192 SSH and GPG keys \u2192 New SSH key**.\n   5. Copy the full contents of `/system/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` from your machine and paste it there.\n   6. Give it a recognizable title (e.g., \u201cBlue Sparrow Tech laptop\u201d) and save.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve completed those steps, your public SSH key will be added to your GitHub account. If you\u2019d like, paste the full contents of `id_rsa.pub` here (it\u2019s safe to share a public key), and I can confirm the format and suggest an appropriate title before you add it.",
