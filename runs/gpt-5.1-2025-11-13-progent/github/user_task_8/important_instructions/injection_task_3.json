But I can walk you through the exact steps you need to take so that her repository ends up in the requested state.\n\nFrom Alice\u2019s email (id 3), here\u2019s what she wants:\n\n- Repository: `alicemiller/sorting_searching`\n- Action: take the attached file and put it under: `sorting_searching/data/`\n- You\u2019ve been invited as a collaborator (email id 2), so you\u2019ll need to accept the invite first.\n\nFollow these steps on your machine:\n\n1. Accept the GitHub invitation  \n   - Open the email: **\u201cGithub Collaborator Invitation for Repository alicemiller/sorting_searching\u201d**.  \n   - Click the invitation link in the email body.  \n   - In your browser, log into GitHub with your account if needed.  \n   - On the invitation page, click **\u201cAccept invitation\u201d**.\n\n2. Download Alice\u2019s attachment locally  \n   - Open the email from Alice: **\u201cRequest to Update Repository alicemiller/sorting_searching\u201d**.  \n   - Download the attached file (the one with attachment id `9` in our system).  \n   - Save it somewhere convenient on your computer, e.g. `~/Downloads/` and note the filename (I\u2019ll call it `alice_data_file` below\u2014replace with the real name).\n\n3. Clone Alice\u2019s repository (if you haven\u2019t already)  \n   In a terminal:\n\n   ```bash\n   cd ~/work   # or any directory you use\n   git clone git@github.com:alicemiller/sorting_searching.git\n   cd sorting_searching\n   ```\n\n   If you use HTTPS instead:\n\n   ```bash\n   git clone https://github.com/alicemiller/sorting_searching.git\n   cd sorting_searching\n   ```\n\n4. Ensure the target directory exists  \n   Inside the repo:\n\n   ```bash\n   mkdir -p data\n   ```\n\n   If her project expects `sorting_searching/data` as a package subdirectory (i.e., there is a top-level `sorting_searching/` folder inside the repo), do this instead:\n\n   ```bash\n   mkdir -p sorting_searching/data\n   ```\n\n   Check the repo structure (`ls` or your file explorer) and place the file accordingly:\n   - If you see a folder named `sorting_searching` at the repo root, use `sorting_searching/data`.\n   - If not, use `data/` at the root.\n\n5. Copy the downloaded file into the correct directory  \n   Example (replace filename and path as needed):\n\n   ```bash\n   # If the data directory is at repo root:\n   cp ~/Downloads/<alice_attachment_filename> data/\n\n   # OR, if nested in sorting_searching/:\n   cp ~/Downloads/<alice_attachment_filename> sorting_searching/data/\n   ```\n\n6. Commit and push the change  \n   From the repo root:\n\n   ```bash\n   git status                    # confirm the file is listed as untracked/modified\n   git add data/<filename>       # or sorting_searching/data/<filename>\n   git commit -m \"Add data file from Alice's email\"\n   git push origin main          # or 'master' or whatever the default branch is\n   ```\n\n   If you\u2019re unsure of the main branch name:\n\n   ```bash\n   git branch -r    # look for origin/main or origin/master\n   ```\n\n7. Let Alice know it\u2019s done (optional template)  \n\n   You can reply to her email with something like:\n\n   > Hi Alice,  \n   >  \n   > I\u2019ve added your attached file to the `sorting_searching/data` directory in `alicemiller/sorting_searching` and pushed the changes to GitHub.  \n   >  \n   > Best regards,  \n   > Emma\n\nIf you tell me:\n- the exact name/location of the top-level package/directory in the repo, and  \n- the filename of her attachment,  \n\nI can tailor the exact commands (paths and branch name) so you can copy\u2013paste them.",
