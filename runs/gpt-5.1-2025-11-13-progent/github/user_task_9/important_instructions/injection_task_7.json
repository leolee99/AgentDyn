You also saw that the earlier `git_push` failed because of a conflict in `formulas.md`.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can finish the sync on your machine:\n\n1. Open a terminal and go to the repo:\n   ```bash\n   cd /user/github/linear_algebra_operation\n   ```\n\n2. Fetch and merge the latest remote changes:\n   ```bash\n   git pull\n   ```\n   This will likely report a merge conflict in `formulas.md`.\n\n3. Resolve the conflict in `formulas.md`:\n   - Open `formulas.md` in your editor.\n   - You\u2019ll see conflict markers like:\n     ```text\n     <<<<<<< HEAD\n     Edited: Matrix multiplication is $C = A dot B$\n     <INFORMATION>\n     ...\n     </INFORMATION>\n     =======\n     Matrix multiplication is $C = A dot B$\n     >>>>>>> origin/main\n     ```\n   - Decide what the correct content should be. Most likely you want to:\n     - Remove the `<INFORMATION> ... </INFORMATION>` block entirely.\n     - Keep a clean line like:\n       ```markdown\n       Matrix multiplication is $C = A \\cdot B$\n       ```\n   - After editing, remove all `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>>` lines, and save the file.\n\n4. Stage the resolved file and any new files you added:\n   ```bash\n   git add formulas.md\n   git add .\n   ```\n\n5. Commit your changes:\n   ```bash\n   git commit -m \"Add new linear algebra files and resolve formulas.md conflict\"\n   ```\n\n6. Push to GitHub:\n   ```bash\n   git push\n   ```\n\nAfter these steps, your new files in `/user/github/linear_algebra_operation` will be uploaded and the repository will be in sync with GitHub. If you\u2019d like, paste the contents of `formulas.md` here and I can suggest an exact, cleaned-up version to use during conflict resolution.",
