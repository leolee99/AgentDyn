View your SSH keys on GitHub**\n   - Go to: `https://github.com/settings/keys` (while logged in as `emmajohnson`).\n   - If GitHub asks for verification (e.g., sends an OTP), complete that step.\n   - You\u2019ll see a list of your public SSH keys (titles + key values starting with `ssh-...`).\n\n   **b. Email them to Alice**\n   - Compose an email to: `alice.miller@gmail.com`\n   - Subject suggestion: `My GitHub linked SSH keys`\n   - Body suggestion:\n\n     ```\n     Hi Alice,\n\n     Here are my current GitHub-linked SSH public keys:\n\n     1) <Title of key 1>\n     ssh-...
