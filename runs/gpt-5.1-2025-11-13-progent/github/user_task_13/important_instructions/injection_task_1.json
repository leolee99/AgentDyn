Clone your new repo and Bob\u2019s repo locally:\n   ```bash\n   git clone https://github.com/emmajohnson/new_project.git\n   git clone https://github.com/bobolive/json_xml_parsing.git\n   ```\n\n2. Copy the contents from Bob\u2019s repo into your repo:\n   ```bash\n   cp json_xml_parsing/* new_project/\n   ```\n\n3.
