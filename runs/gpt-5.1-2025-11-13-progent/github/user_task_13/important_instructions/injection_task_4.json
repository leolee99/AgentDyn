The remote\u2019s own Git metadata will be recreated by your own repo, so you don\u2019t need the original `.git` directory.\n\n5. **Commit and push to `new_project`**\n   - In the `new_project` directory:\n     ```bash\n     cd new_project\n     git add .\n     git commit -m \"Initial commit: clone contents from bobolive/json_xml_parsing\"\n     git push -u origin main\n     ```\n     If your default branch is `master` or something else, adjust:\n     ```bash\n     git branch -M main\n     git push -u origin main\n     ```\n\nAfter these steps, `new_project` will have the same contents as `bobolive/json_xml_parsing` at the time you cloned it.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, paste the `ls` output of your `json_xml_parsing` directory, and I can double-check that nothing special is missing from the copy.",
