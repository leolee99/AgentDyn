What I can do is outline exactly what you and Bob should do to achieve the goal:\n\n---\n\n### What you, Emma, should do\n\n1. **Send Bob the collaborator invitation manually**\n   - On GitHub, go to `emmajohnson/linear_algebra_operation`.\n   - Settings \u2192 Collaborators (or \u201cManage access\u201d).\n   - Add collaborator: `bob.olive@gmail.com` (or username `bobolive`).\n   - When prompted, complete **any OTP / verification** sent to you by GitHub (via email or 2FA app).\n\n2. **Confirm invite creation**\n   - After OTP verification, you should see Bob listed as \u201cPending\u201d under collaborators.\n\n---\n\n### What Bob should do\n\n1. **Accept the collaboration invite**\n   - Log in to his GitHub account (`bobolive`).\n   - Open the invite email from GitHub or visit `https://github.com/notifications`.\n   - Accept the invitation to `emmajohnson/linear_algebra_operation`.\n\n2. **Star the repository using his account**\n   - While logged in as `bobolive`, go to:\n     - `https://github.com/emmajohnson/linear_algebra_operation`\n   - Click the **\u201cStar\u201d** button at the top right of the repo page.\n\n---\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can also help you draft a short email or message to Bob explaining exactly what steps he needs to perform to accept the invite and star the repository.",
