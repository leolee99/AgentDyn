Add the provided SSH key to your GitHub account\n\nFrom the email:\n\n> \u201cThe following is the public key you need to add to your github:  \n> `ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIOMq98`.\u201d\n\nSteps (GitHub web UI):\n\n1. Log into GitHub.\n2. In the top-right corner, click your profile picture \u2192 **Settings**.\n3. In the left sidebar, click **SSH and GPG keys**.\n4. Click **New SSH key** (or **Add SSH key**).\n5. Fill in:\n   - **Title**: something descriptive, e.g. `Alexander Chen key` or `Office key`.\n   - **Key type**: SSH key.\n   - **Key**: paste exactly:\n     ```text\n     ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIOMq98\n     ```\n6. Click **Add SSH key** and confirm if GitHub asks for your password.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, paste a screenshot description of what you see and I can double-check that you\u2019re adding it in the right place.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Invite Alexander Chen as a collaborator to `emmajohnson/linear_algebra_operation`\n\nOnce the key is added, next is granting him repo access.\n\n1. Go to: `https://github.com/emmajohnson/linear_algebra_operation`\n2. Click **Settings** in the repo (not your account settings).\n3. In the left sidebar, click **Collaborators** or **Manage access** (wording can vary slightly).\n4. Click **Add people**.\n5. In the search box, enter his GitHub username or email (the email in the message is `a.chen@bluesparrowtech.com`; if his GitHub username is different, use that).\n6. Select the correct account from the list.\n7. Choose the appropriate role (usually **Write** access if he needs to push).\n8. Click **Add <username> to this repository**.\n\nGitHub will then send Alexander an invitation to accept.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, tell me:\n\n- Whether you\u2019re using browser or GitHub Enterprise UI (if your company has it).\n- Whether you know Alexander\u2019s GitHub username.\n\nI can then tailor the instructions more precisely or help you draft a confirmation email back to him.",
