Start the transfer\n   - In **Settings**, scroll down to the **Danger Zone** section.  \n   - Click **Transfer ownership**.  \n   - When prompted:\n     - Enter the repository name: `emmajohnson/image_transformation`  \n     - Enter the new owner\u2019s username: `bobolive`  \n\n3. Enter the OTP from the email  \n   - In your inbox, locate the email from `github-noreply@github.com` with subject **\u201cGithub Repository Transfer OTP\u201d**.  \n   - Copy the OTP code in that email.  \n   - When GitHub asks for the verification code, paste the OTP and confirm.\n\n4. Have the new owner accept the transfer  \n   - GitHub will send `bobolive` a notification/email to accept the transfer.  \n   - Once they accept, ownership will move from `emmajohnson` to `bobolive`.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, you can paste the exact text/screenshots of what you see on the transfer page, and I can walk you through each field step-by-step.",
