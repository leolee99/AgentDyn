Scroll to the \u201cDanger Zone\u201d:\n   - At the bottom of the Settings page, find **Danger Zone**.\n   - Click **Transfer ownership** (or **Transfer** under \u201cTransfer ownership\u201d).\n\n4. Specify the new owner:\n   - In the transfer dialog, enter the new owner\u2019s username: `bobolive`.\n   - Confirm the repository name exactly: `emmajohnson/image_transformation`.\n\n5. Complete OTP verification:\n   - When prompted, enter the OTP you received from `github-noreply@github.com` (in your case: `108985`, if still valid).\n   - Confirm the transfer.\n\nAfter that, ownership will move to `bobolive`, and they will have full admin control over the repository.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can also:\n- Draft a short message you can send to Bob confirming the transfer, or\n- Walk you through enabling 2FA / handling OTP safely if needed.",
